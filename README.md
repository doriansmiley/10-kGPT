# 10-kGPT

IMPORTANT: this project is very early in development. Expect issues!!!

# Background
I started this aas a TypeScript app but I got a CORS block from the SEC.
So I moved it to Node. The script will scrape the SEC site for 10Q's for Palantir
then ask GPT to summerize and save the ouput to the `responses` directory.

It's important to note you can't just pass the entire filling or you will hit GPT token limits.
This is why I parse the tables from the page HTML, which is the most dogshit HTML I have ever seen.

# Help Wanted
I'd like to: 
- Figure out how to summerize the responses and get a final score on whether to invest
- Store SEC filings, the inputs to OpenAI, and responses in a vector database
- Implement LangChain or Haystack to generate and retrieve summaries using a supported LLM

The responses need to be improved as well. We need to track the URL of the 10-Q that the page comes from. Also, I have ssen the model outputing wierd lage numbers at the bootom of the page in some cases. This prompt may need improvement: `Indicate the page number using ${fileName}`. The unltimate goal is to audit the responses and rate them 0-7 for quality after a manual review of the 10-Q.

It's important to note you can't just pass the entire filling or you will hit GPT token limits.

# Setup
`npm install`

# Run
- Create the pages directory. This is where pages are saved for research puposes. I ignore this directory since it will result in a large number of files. After creating the pages directory 
- Creatre your .env file and add `OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>`, `SEC_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>` and `SEC_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.sec-api.io/`
- run `npm run start $TICKER` passing the ticker symbol of the ocmpany you want to analyze.

This will run `node node-index` passing the ticker symbok you specify and save responses to the `responses` directory. 

You can view output in the responses directory. The chunks used to generate each response is under 
`responses/secAPI`. This can be useful to audit what inputs were used to generatr the response. 

Please note all output will be overwritten with each run. This is to reduce file build up.
