The information provided in the SEC filing indicates a negative trend in the financial performance of Palantir Technologies Inc. The company has been facing challenges in realizing deferred tax assets and maintains a significant valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. While the company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $70.8 million related to capitalizing research and experimental expenditures, it also added $74.1 million to its valuation allowance in 2022. Additionally, the company has net operating losses and research and development credits carryforwards that may expire before utilization due to annual limitation constraints. The company has also recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $81.9 million that currently offset deferred tax assets, which may not benefit the company's effective tax rate. Finally, the net loss per share attributable to common shareholders has been increasing over the years, indicating a negative trend in the company's profitability. All these factors indicate a negative trend in the company's financial performance and suggest a below-average score for a high-growth company.</body></html>
