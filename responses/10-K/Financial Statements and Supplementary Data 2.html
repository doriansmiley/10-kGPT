Summary: The financial statements indicate a positive trend for Palantir Technologies Inc. The company's stockholders' equity increased from $2.29 million in 2021 to $2.64 million in 2022 due to the issuance of common stock, exercised stock options, and vested RSUs. Additionally, the company's net cash provided by operating activities increased from $333.85 million in 2021 to $223.73 million in 2022. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was due to the changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions. Palantir's net loss decreased, from $520.38 million in 2021 to $371.09 million in 2022, due to the decrease in other operating expenses and an increase in unrealized and realized gains from marketable securities.
