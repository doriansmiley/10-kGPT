The information provided has a neutral effect on a potential investor. The company has no outstanding debt balances under the 2014 Credit Facility, which is positive. However, the company has undrawn revolving and DDTL commitments of $950.0 million, which could potentially add to the company's debt burden. 

The company has operating leases for office spaces and equipment, with remaining lease terms up to 2033. This could be a negative aspect for the company as it adds to the company's expenses. 

The company has a minimum annual commitment to purchase cloud hosting services of at least $1.49 billion over six contract years, which could be a risk for the company as it can lead to additional expenses.

There are litigation and legal proceedings against the company, which pose a risk to its financial stability. The company has established an accrual for loss contingencies, but the outcome of any legal proceedings is unknown. Overall, the score is average, as the positive aspect of no outstanding debt balances is offset by the potential for additional debt from undrawn commitments and the risks posed by the company's lease agreements and legal proceedings.</body></html>
