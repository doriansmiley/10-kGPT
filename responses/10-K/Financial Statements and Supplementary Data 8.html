- Letters of Credit and Guarantees: The company had outstanding letters of credit and guarantees totaling $28.8 million and $76.2 million as of Dec 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively. These are necessary for operating lease agreements, customer contracts, and other financing arrangements.

The company has not recorded any liability for warranty or infringement costs as of Dec 31, 2022 and 2021.
- Stockholders' Equity: The company has authorized 20 billion shares of Class A common stock, 2.7 billion shares of Class B common stock, and 1,005 shares of Class F common stock. The common stock has the same rights, except for voting and conversion rights. The Founders hold all the Class F common stock, which gives them control of up to 49.999999 % of the total voting power of the company's capital stock.

The exercise price of options granted is at least equal to the fair market value of the company's Class A common stock, and options and other equity awards become vested based on terms determined by the Board of Directors or another plan administrator on the date of grant.</body></html>
