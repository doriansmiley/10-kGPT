The information provided in the filing suggests a negative outlook for potential investors as the company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders and a loss from operations. Additionally, the operating expenses increased slightly compared to the previous year, and the company is not allocating certain operating expenses to operating segments. However, revenue increased by 24%, driven by increases in revenue from government customers and new commercial customers. The company's gross margin increased by 1% compared to the previous year, owing to revenue growth outpacing costs of revenue.
