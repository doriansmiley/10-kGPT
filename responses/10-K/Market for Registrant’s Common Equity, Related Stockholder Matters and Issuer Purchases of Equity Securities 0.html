The information provided in this section of the filing is negative for a potential investor. There is no public trading market for the Class B common stock and Class F common stock, and dividend payments are not expected in the foreseeable future. Additionally, the performance graph included in the filing shows a decline in the cumulative total return to stockholders on Class A common stock since the date of its trading commenced on the NYSE. While unregistered sales of equity securities have not taken place, the overall lack of market activity and limited shareholder information suggests a less than promising investment opportunity.</body></html>
