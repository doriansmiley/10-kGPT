The company's operations and customer services are vulnerable to damage or interruption due to various factors such as power loss, telecommunication failures, and system failures, which may result in performance problems or failure of infrastructure, technology, or platforms. The company's ability to conduct normal business operations could be severely affected, and any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm the company's reputation and brand. Furthermore, the company's platforms are essential to its customers' operations, including their cybersecurity or oversight and compliance programs, any interruption in service could damage the company's brand and reputation, cause customers to terminate or not renew their contracts with the company, and result in other losses or liabilities. The filing also highlights the challenges faced by the company in maintaining relationships with third-party providers, obtaining, maintaining, protecting, and enforcing its intellectual property and other proprietary rights. The company's involvement in standard-setting activities or the need to obtain licenses from others may require the company to license its intellectual property, and the laws of some countries may not be as protective of intellectual property and other proprietary rights as those in the United States, which could expose the company to significant liability for damages.
