Score: Below Average

Explanation: The information suggests that the company faces a significant risk of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of its intellectual property and other proprietary rights. The risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims is high, and such claims are difficult to predict and expensive to settle or litigate. The company's agreements with customers and other third parties to indemnify them could result in large payments and harm the company's financial condition. Additionally, the company may be exposed to heightened risks of unauthorized access to its proprietary and competitively sensitive information due to cyberattacks. Therefore, the overall assessment is negative, and the score is below average.</body></html>
