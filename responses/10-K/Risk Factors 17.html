This information presents a risk to potential investors about various legal, regulatory, and administrative inquiries and proceedings that the company is currently or has been involved in, which could negatively impact the business, financial condition, and results of operations. The legal disputes have involved several areas, including labor and employment, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, class actions, tort, defamation, data privacy rights, antitrust, and common law fraud, and investing in the company could lead to costly litigation or undesirable changes in platforms or business practices. Furthermore, failure to comply with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, including FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act, could result in significant legal fees, adverse media coverage, investigations, and criminal or civil sanctions that negatively affect the reputation and growth prospects of the business. There is also a risk associated with governmental trade controls like export and import controls, sanctions, customs requirements, and related regimes that could restrict the company's ability to compete in certain markets, and any violations could lead to significant fines or penalties.</body></html>
