Summary: The company's business heavily relies on government contracts and changes in fiscal policies, contracting policies or decreases in available government funding could adversely affect the business. The company's business prospects in certain non-U.S. geographies or with certain non-U.S. governments could also be adversely affected by the perceived relationship with the U.S. government. The company faces several risks and challenges when selling to government agencies, including fierce competition, high costs, and the need to comply with specific laws and regulations. The company's contracts with governments involving classified programs limit investor insight into these portions of the business. Moreover, obtaining and maintaining security clearances for employees and facility security clearances is crucial to the company's ability to bid on or win new classified contracts. The company's customer contracts may be terminated at any time for convenience, and its government contracts often contain provisions with additional rights and remedies favorable to the government customers. 

The risks associated with the company's business are significant, and investors should carefully consider these risks before investing in the company.</body></html>
