The page extracted from the 10-Q filing provides a list of factors that may cause fluctuations in the company's quarterly results of operations and financial position. The company highlights the difficulty in predicting financial metrics for any particular period due to the variability and unpredictability of its quarterly results of operations, cash flows, or other operating metrics. This may result in the company's failure to meet the expectations of analysts covering the company or investors with respect to revenue or other key metrics. 

Moreover, the company identifies various negative factors that could adversely affect its business operations, such as termination of one or more large contracts by customers, interruptions or delays in its operations and maintenance services, cyberattacks or data security breaches, and changes in laws and regulations that impact its business, to name a few. 

The seasonality trend observed by the company in its quarterly sales may continue in the future, causing fluctuations in its results of operations and cash flows, which could prevent it from achieving its quarterly or annual forecasts. The company also emphasizes the complex nature of its platforms and services and the lengthy implementation process, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and subsequently reduce customer payments or legal claims against the company. 

Overall, based on the factors stated above, a potential investor may view the information as negative and assign a below-average score to the company's performance compared to an average high growth company.</body></html>
