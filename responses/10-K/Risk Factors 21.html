The listed factors in the filing include a range of risks and uncertainties that could negatively impact the company's financial performance and stock value. The stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations that could impact the company's performance regardless of its actual operating performance. The risk of litigation, including class action lawsuits, and regulatory investigations could harm the company's financial condition and operating results, and the bylaws restricting lawsuits to specific courts may limit stockholders' ability to seek redress. The largest risk factor is the potential for substantial sales of Class A common stock by executives, which could lead to a decline in stock price due to oversupply. When combined, these risks present a below-average outlook for investors considering buying the company's stock.</body></html>
