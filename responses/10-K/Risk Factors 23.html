The information provided in the excerpt is negative for a potential investor. The multiple class structure of common stock concentrates voting power with the founders and affiliates, effectively eliminating the ability of common shareholders to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control. The concentration of voting power and founder control limits the likelihood of potential mergers, tender offers or proxy contests. The founder voting trust agreement, founder voting agreement and the concentration of voting power among founders make it difficult for stockholders to replace directors and management. Stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment, and the company does not anticipate paying dividends to investors in the foreseeable future. Additionally, amendments to the voting trust agreement or founder voting agreement in the future may work against stockholders. Despite the risks involved, given the performance of average high growth companies, the score is below average.</body></html>
