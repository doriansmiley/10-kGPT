The information provided in the filing indicates that the multi-class structure of the company's common stock could have a negative impact on potential investors. The Founders of the company who are party to the Founder Voting Agreement have significant control over the voting power of the common stock, and the transfer or disposal of their shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock does not diminish their voting control as long as they meet the Ownership Threshold. Additionally, the multi-class capital structure of the company may make it ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, which could depress the stock's valuation compared to similar companies. Finally, future issuances of Class A common stock will dilute the voting power of Class A common stockholders and not necessarily of the Founders who are party to the Founder Voting Agreement due to the voting rights of the Class F common stock. All of these factors could negatively affect the decision by certain institutional investors to purchase or hold shares of the company's Class A common stock.</body></html>
