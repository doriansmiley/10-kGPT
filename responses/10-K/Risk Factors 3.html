The page extracted from the filing highlights several risks that could harm the company's financial condition, operations, and prospects. The company's success depends on its ability to develop and deploy new technologies to meet the rapidly evolving needs of its customers. However, there is no assurance that the new product features or offerings will be compelling to its customers or gain market acceptance. The introduction of new products and services by competitors or development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could make the company's platforms obsolete or adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Moreover, the design and development of new platforms or new features and capabilities to existing platforms may require substantial investment, and the company has no assurance that such investments will be successful. The company's new and existing platforms and changes to existing platforms could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons.

Furthermore, the company's ability to compete depends on its ability to attract, motivate, and retain qualified personnel. The loss of services of key personnel and any other executive officers, and the inability to find suitable replacements, could result in a decline in sales, delays in product development, and harm to its business and operations. 

Overall, the risks highlighted on this page suggest that a potential investor should be cautious in investing in the company, and the score is below average compared to an average high-growth company.</body></html>
