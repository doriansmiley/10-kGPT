Analysis: 

The information provided in the 10-Q and 10-K filings indicates that the company faces significant challenges in hiring and retaining qualified personnel, specifically in major U.S. markets where there is intense competition for engineering personnel. Additionally, the company is dependent on the quality of its services to retain customers, and any failure to offer high-quality services could have an adverse effect on the company's sales and results of operations. The company is also investing significant resources in building and expanding its sales organization and operations, which requires identifying, recruiting, training, and managing sales personnel, among other things. The success of the company's strategy to increase its sales to existing customers and enter new markets depends on its ability to do so in a timely and effective manner. Moreover, as the company expands outside the United States, it needs to ensure that it can provide efficient O&M services globally at scale, which may require hiring additional services personnel. These challenges and risks faced by the company could negatively impact its revenue growth, financial condition, and results of operations.</body></html>
