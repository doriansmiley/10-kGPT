Summary:
The information provided in the SEC filing suggests that the company's ability to maintain and enhance their brand identity and reputation may become increasingly difficult and expensive as the market becomes increasingly competitive. Unfavorable media coverage could damage the company's reputation, which could adversely affect their relationships with current and potential customers, employees, and investors. The company's relationships with government customers and customers that are engaged in certain sensitive industries could also result in public criticism and unfavorable media coverage, potentially engendering dissatisfaction among potential and existing customers, investors, and employees. Furthermore, downturns or upturns in new sales and renewals may not be immediately reflected in the company's results of operations, while changes in pricing structures could adversely impact their business, financial condition, and results of operations. Finally, the company's product-based business model may be a concern for potential customers, who are generally familiar with the practice of purchasing or licensing software through labor contracts.</body></html>
