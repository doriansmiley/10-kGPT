The information extracted from the filing highlights several risks present in the business. Primarily, the company's dependence on large enterprises and government entities may lead to longer implementation cycles, require greater expenses, and delay revenue recognition. Similarly, engaging third parties to use the platforms may result in contractual complexities and add risks to business conducted with these customers. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and related challenging macroeconomic conditions, along with market uncertainties, may disrupt the business's operations, decrease IT budgets, and negatively affect the demand for the platform and services. The risks associated with the growth of business in new commercial markets and with new customer verticals are also highlighted. These risks can drag the growth of the company, leading to lower revenue and adversely impact the business's financial condition overall. Therefore, the filing's overall outlook appears negative for a prospective investor, with a below-average score on the average high-growth company performance scale.</body></html>
