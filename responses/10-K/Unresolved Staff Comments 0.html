The information provided in ITEM 1B is neutral to a perspective investor. The absence of any unresolved staff comments is a positive sign, indicating that the company's financial statements have been satisfactorily reviewed and any concerns or queries have been effectively addressed. However, as this is a routine disclosure and does not provide any significant insight into the actual financial performance of the company, the score is average, based on the performance of an average high-growth company.</body></html>
