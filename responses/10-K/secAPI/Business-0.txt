 ITEM 1. BUSINESS  Overview  We build software that empowers organizations to effectively integrate their data, decisions, and operations at scale.  We were founded in 2003 and started building software for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations. We later began working with commercial enterprises, who often faced fundamentally similar challenges in working with data.  We have built three principal software platforms, Palantir Gotham (&#8220;Gotham&#8221;), Palantir Foundry (&#8220;Foundry&#8221;), and Palantir Apollo (&#8220;Apollo&#8221;). Gotham and Foundry enable institutions to transform massive amounts of information into an integrated data asset that reflects their operations. For over a decade, Gotham has surfaced insights for global defense agencies, the intelligence community, disaster relief organizations and beyond. And Foundry is becoming a central operating system not only for individual institutions but also for entire industries. Apollo is a cloud-agnostic, single control layer that coordinates ongoing delivery of new features, security updates, and platform configurations, helping to ensure the continuous operation of critical systems and allowing our customers to run their software in virtually any environment.  Recent crises and systemic shocks, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, have made clear to many of our customers that accommodating the extended timelines ordinarily required to realize results from implementing new software solutions is not a viable option. As a result, customers are increasingly adopting our software, which can be ready in days, over internal software development efforts, which may take months or years. See further discussion  in the section titled &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Macroeconomic Trends . &#8221;  Our Platforms  We have built three principal software platforms: Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo. Our software platforms provide the critical infrastructure needed to integrate our customers&#8217; data and operations and run their software in virtually any environment.  The vertically integrated nature of Gotham and Foundry allows users of varying technical abilities to collaborate effectively in our platforms. Data engineers can integrate new data sources, analysts can clean and transform data, data scientists can write models, business users can conduct daily workflows, and senior leaders can make critical decisions. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem.  Data, analyses, decisions, and the metadata around each are secured with fine-grained access controls that propagate from source data to shared analyses. Each platform is comprised of user-facing applications that are targeted to the specific industries and sectors in which they are used.  Despite their differences, Gotham and Foundry both serve as central operating systems for our customers. Where they vary in specific functionality, they align in approach. Both platforms, backed by Apollo, can be deployed in almost any environment.  Similarly, customers can now use Apollo to enable continuous deployment, configuration management, and central software operations management across almost any environment for their own software products.  Gotham  Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants. It also facilitates the hand-off between analysts and operational users, helping operators plan and execute real-world responses to threats that have been identified within the platform. Gotham is now used broadly across government functions.  We also offer Gotham to our commercial customers, including to those in the financial services industry in connection with fraud investigations.  Foundry  Foundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data. Individual users can integrate and analyze the data they need in one place. The speed with which users can experiment and test new ideas is what makes the software stick.  Data projects often fail because the steps and methods used to build data pipelines are difficult to understand and recreate. We built Foundry&#8217;s backend to solve the root of this problem. The platform&#8217;s graphical interface does the rest, allowing users to track and trace their pipelines so they know what the rows and columns in their tables represent and why they are there. All of our commercial customers now use it, as do several of our government customers.  Apollo  We have always prioritized meeting our customers wherever they need us most. We originally built Apollo to enable the continuous delivery of our software wherever our customers are: in the cloud, on-premises, or even more rugged environments. Today, Apollo enables the rapid, secure delivery of our software and updates across our business.  In 2021, we began offering Apollo as a commercial solution to allow our customers to securely deploy their own software in virtually any environment. Apollo provides a single control layer to coordinate ongoing delivery of new features, security updates, and platform configurations.  Our Customers  We work with many of the world&#8217;s leading government and commercial institutions. As of December 31, 2022, we had 367 customers.  An overview of those customers and the ways in which they use our software follows below.  Overview  Our software is currently used across more than 60 industries around the world.  Of the $1.9 billion in revenue that we generated in 2022, 56% came from customers in the government segment, and 44% came from customers in the commercial segment.  Our business continues to have a global presence. In 2022, we earned 61% of our revenue from customers in the United States, and 39% from those abroad.  The average revenue for our top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2022 was $49.4 million, and is up from 2021, when the average revenue from our top 20 customers during the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was $43.6 million, demonstrating our expanding relationships with existing customers.  Our Software at Work  Our software is in the hands of factory workers, soldiers, clinicians, prosecutors, investigators, claims adjusters, technicians, intelligence analysts, and social workers around the world. It is used in a variety of applications including by utility operations analysts, automotive manufacturing workers, oil and gas technicians and operators, and pharmaceutical researchers in the United States; supply-chain managers in South Korea; assembly workers in France; public health administrators in the United Kingdom and the United States; and special forces personnel and military officials in the United States and abroad.  Industries and Sectors  In addition to supporting individual institutions, our platforms have become central operating systems for entire industries and sectors.  Our work with Airbus S.A.S. (&#8220;Airbus&#8221;), for example, was initially focused on the production of the A350 aircraft. The deployment of our software soon grew into Skywise, our aviation platform that has become the central operating system of the airline industry.  Skywise connects more than 10,000 aircraft across a growing community of airlines, maintenance and repair organizations, authorities, and Airbus. Decision makers at each of these institutions use Skywise to more efficiently design, manufacture, service, operate, and maintain their global fleets.  Our work with healthcare organizations across both the commercial and government sectors in the United States and globally has helped modernize public health information systems, including by facilitating pandemic management across U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies, integrating and harmonizing clinical trial data, and enabling proactive coordination across multi-threaded teams to effectively respond to real-time changes in patient demand and nursing supply.  Similarly, when it comes to our work with defense and intelligence agencies, our software is not only used by individual organizations but is also used to enable sharing of information and collaboration across agencies and countries. This is made possible by our software&#8217;s access controls, which enable agencies to work on the same platform simultaneously and securely.  Sales and Marketing  Our approach to sales and marketing is built around discussions with existing and prospective customers in order to understand the principal challenges our customers face and identify ways in which our software platforms can provide long-term value and results.  Customer Acquisition  Our customer acquisition strategy targets large-scale, hard-to-execute opportunities at large government and commercial institutions. The high installation costs, high failure risks, complexity of data environments, and the long sales cycles associated with these opportunities raise the barriers to entry for competition. The larger, more complex, and more technologically demanding the problem, the more likely we are to succeed. Additionally, our focus in the short term remains making our principal software platforms available to an increasingly broad swath of our potential market. We believe that every institution faces challenges that our platforms and products were designed to address.  Across both the public and private sectors, there is a history of failures when investing in new technologies. One U.S. military department spent more than $1 billion building an enterprise resource planning system from scratch. The system was never delivered, and the project was terminated.  Many of our customers have had similar experiences investing millions &#8212; even billions &#8212; of dollars in digital transformation projects, enterprise data warehouses, and digital twin initiatives that never really worked.  These failures have made both software buyers and vendors highly risk-averse. Institutions often doubt that any vendor can implement a working solution and are unwilling to invest. On the other hand, smaller technology companies are often unable to compete for complex, large-scale opportunities because installation costs and the risks of failure are too high, and the sales cycles too long.
