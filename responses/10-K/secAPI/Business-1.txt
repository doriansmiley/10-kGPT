These are precisely the opportunities we target. Rather than reject projects with risky and resource intensive installation requirements, we actively seek them out.  There are a number of sales and marketing strategies that have accelerated our ability to acquire customers in recent years:  Expansion of Access to Platforms  The speed with which our platforms can be deployed has significantly expanded the range of potential customers with which we plan on partnering over the long term. We anticipate that our reach among an increasingly broad set of customers, in both the commercial and government sectors, will accelerate moving forward. We believe that, as these new partners grow, we will grow with them.  We have also made a number of investments in companies whose businesses rely on the ability of their organizations to manage and analyze data effectively at scale, though we do not currently anticipate entering into new investments to purchase, or commit to purchase, securities of special purpose acquisition companies.  Our proximity to these businesses and the industries in which they are operating has enhanced, and is expected to continue enhancing, our own product and business development efforts, as we continue expanding access to our platforms to the broadest possible set of customers.  Direct Sales Force  We have invested and continue to invest in an account-based sales force to identify and capture new customers and opportunities.  We believe that our decision to grow our sales force in recent years has resulted in multiple new customers, broadening and expanding our commercial customer base and relationships with leading government agencies around the world.  Sector and Industry Platforms  We are developing industry operating systems to help companies and government agencies manage operations across their entire organizations. These operating systems allow our software to be distributed at scale to institutions within given industries.  For example, Skywise is our aviation platform that we have developed in partnership with Airbus. Our approach with Airbus involves a collaborative go-to-market strategy to distribute the Foundry platform across the aviation industry. The adoption of our software has been swift. Since June 2017, Skywise has expanded from zero to more than one hundred airlines on the platform. Each one is now an existing or potential customer.  We are working on similar partnerships in the insurance, healthcare, automotive, and government sectors, which we anticipate will have a significant impact on our business moving forward.  U.S. Government  We intend to capture an even greater share of U.S. federal government spending on software systems, following our 2018 legal victory in federal court. The ruling requires the government to consider commercially available products, such as our software, before attempting to build its own.  See the section titled &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Overview&#8212;Our Customers&#8221; for a discussion of the terms of our government contracts.  Channel Sales &#38; Cloud Partnerships  We have entered into, and continue to explore the development of, channel sales partnerships for specific industries and sectors by partnering closely with leading providers of public, private, and hybrid cloud services, which have relationships with essentially every major enterprise in the world and have large, existing sales forces.  This channel emerged as an extension of the large computing requirements for our platforms and the migration towards the cloud as the hosting environment of choice for many customers. The existing footprint of these providers provides us with access to their large customer base and expands our distribution capabilities.  Joint Ventures &#38; New Business Partnerships  We intend to continue to form joint ventures and new business partnerships, where we believe specific industries or sectors require a partner and additional investment in order to realize the full potential of our platforms.  Account Growth  There are a number of sales and marketing strategies that we use to drive revenue growth at an account.  These strategies include (i) creating new ecosystem partnerships to extend the platform beyond the customer&#8217;s four walls into the operations of its partners and suppliers, (ii) selling additional productized cross-industry software capabilities, and (iii) selling strategic implementations of our software against specific use cases, which deliver competitive differentiation.  Our sales and marketing strategies allow us to scale existing customer contracts horizontally to include additional divisions or functions within a single institution and vertically to include additional users and user groups. In tackling the customer&#8217;s most pressing and challenging problems first, we establish the trust needed to expand platform usage across the full enterprise.  Research and Development  We believe that in order to fully address the most complex and valuable challenges that our customers face, we must experience and understand their problems firsthand. To do so, we embed with our users. Our research and development function is responsible for the design, development, testing, validation, and refinement of our platforms, and embedding with our users allows us to identify research and development opportunities for our platforms or new products. We focus on innovating and developing new features and modules for our existing platforms, or new products, and further enhancing the functionality, reliability, usability, and performance of our platforms. By leveraging the tens of thousands of front-line hours across various industries and using emerging technologies, we can better anticipate customer needs and bring new use cases and new applications of existing services to our existing and potential customers. Many of our current research and development efforts are focused on deploying software, models, and other critical assets at the edge. This includes integrations with complex hardware, operations in disconnected environments, and more. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in research and development to broaden our platform capabilities, strengthen our existing platforms and innovate.  Privacy and Civil Liberties  We are committed to ensuring that our software is as effective as possible while preserving individuals&#8217; fundamental rights to privacy and civil liberties. We have made deep investments to ensure that safeguarding privacy and civil liberties protections remains central to our software and business practices.  Our platforms were built from the start to protect individual privacy and prevent the misuse of information. We are not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build software platforms that enable our customers to integrate their own data &#8212; data that they already have.  The same technology that makes Palantir so analytically powerful &#8212; its ability to construct a model of the real world from countless data points &#8212; is what allows our customers to monitor and control access to that data and its use.  Principles  As we build and implement technology to answer questions of increasing significance and complexity, we follow a set of principles that help us ensure we are doing so responsibly.  &#8226; Systems should incorporate principles of &#8220;privacy by design.&#8221; Our goal has always been to eliminate the perceived trade-offs between privacy and utility. To do so, we treat privacy as a first-order concern at every stage of the engineering process and build privacy features as core capabilities in our platforms, seamlessly integrated with analytical and collaboration tools.  &#8226; Decisions that can affect individuals&#8217; rights to freedom, opportunity, and happiness cannot be left solely to computers. Our customers are using data to inform decisions with significant implications for individuals. Rather than relying on algorithms that inhibit accountability and redress, we build in means for humans to make necessary judgment calls based on their context and intuition.  &#8226; Systems must facilitate accountability and oversight. Effective privacy protection entails multi-layered, overlapping policies and procedures to reassure the protection of fundamental rights. We design our platforms to support these policies with mechanisms that control usage, alert users to data handling requirements, and generate information for those responsible for oversight.  &#8226; Technology is not the answer to every problem. Some decisions carry implications that are too complex or significant to be automated or streamlined, even with a human in the loop. We strive to contextualize major world problems and think critically about whether it&#8217;s possible to engineer complementary solutions in an ethically responsible way. When the answer is no, we turn the opportunity down. Privacy and civil liberties engineering is an evolving field, and every organization is subject to unique requirements and concerns. The ways in which these principles are realized will differ among products and organizations. But the end goal should be the same: developing and implementing technology with a full understanding of its potential effects on fundamental rights and incorporating technical capabilities that can support responsible data handling policies.  Customer Impact  Some examples of the ways in which our software facilitates data protection at our customers follow below.  &#8226; Our platforms provide a secure, privacy-protective cloud-based data enclave to centralize data on COVID-19 for collaborative clinical research.  &#8226; Our platforms serve as the central analytics system of a major law enforcement agency in northern Europe. Scandinavia has long been at the forefront of data protection, and our software facilitates effective implementation of its rigorous privacy policies.  &#8226; A customer in Europe needed to adhere to rigorous purpose specification and proportionality requirements during sensitive analytical workflows. We worked with the customer to implement technical measures requiring analysts to provide reviewable justifications for access. Those controls were further supported by auditing capabilities to ensure that data processing satisfied legitimate purposes under the relevant regulations.
