&#8226; A multinational insurer sought to build and apply machine-learning models to surface fraudulent insurance claims, while ensuring that processing was sufficiently transparent, interpretable, and accountable to decision makers and oversight authorities. We helped to configure and implement a number of supporting privacy-enhancing features, including pseudonymization processes to minimize data exposure, rigorous documentation of machine learning model features and parameters, and auditing tools for users and regulators.  Our Team  We employ a team of engineers, lawyers, and social scientists to ensure that our company remains a leader in the field when it comes to privacy practices and software development.  The Privacy and Civil Liberties Engineering team is responsible for ensuring a culture of responsibility around the development and use of our technology by leading the development of privacy-enhancing technologies, publishing research, consulting with policymakers, helping our customers implement data governance best practices, and facilitating company-wide dialogue on ethical issues. The team is supported by the Palantir Council of Advisors on Privacy and Civil Liberties, a group of independent experts in privacy law, policy, and ethics who help us to understand and address the implications of our work.  Privacy-Enhancing Technologies  &#8226; Access Controls. Our platforms provide highly granular access restrictions with subtle and flexible access permissions, such as temporal and purpose-based limitations. This allows for precision data management &#8212; even, at times, across multiple, independent databases &#8212; that closely aligns access with customer specifications. For example, a user sees only the specific information necessary for a defined task (e.g., investigating a specific crime or determining whether to extend credit to an individual).  &#8226; Sensitive Data Inference. Institutions managing sprawling collections of data often struggle to keep track of which data assets include sensitive fields such as personal identifiers or health records. Our software provides inference tools to assist institutions in detecting the presence of such data so that they can flag and handle the data appropriately.  &#8226; Federation. Federation allows users to search and analyze data from multiple, independent databases without duplicating and centralizing data in a single place. Our platforms provide intelligent query interfaces that reduce the  complexity of federation so that users can access the information they need without directly integrating the source into the platform.  &#8226; Audit Logging and Analysis. User actions &#8212; including searches, data use justifications, access requests, analyst collaborations, and report generation &#8212; within a system must be recorded to ensure that authorized oversight entities, both internal to an institution and external, can confirm appropriate and lawful data usage. Our platforms maintain audit logs and make them accessible to (and readable by) authorized users to help them both retroactively investigate and proactively identify misuse of systems.  &#8226; Data Integrity and Redress. Our platforms track the provenance and version history of all data in the system so that users can assess the reliability of the data and review and correct inaccuracies. Providing users with well-curated, up-to-date data reduces the risks of erroneous conclusions.  &#8226; Data Retention and Deletion. Institutions must be able to implement flexible and auditable retention policies and verify that data flagged for deletion has truly been purged from the system. Our platforms enable institutions to schedule and manage the removal of old or irrelevant information as required by data management best practices or applicable regulations.  Competition  We are fundamentally competing with the internal software development efforts of our potential customers.  Organizations frequently attempt to build their own data platforms before turning to buy ours. In trying to build something on their own, they generally rely on a patchwork of custom solutions, outside consultants, IT services companies, packaged enterprise and open source software, and significant internal IT resources.  In addition, our competitors include large enterprise software companies, government contractors, and system integrators. We also face competition from emerging companies as well as established companies that are only now beginning to enter this market.  The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include:  &#8226; platform capabilities and product functionality;  &#8226; data security and privacy;  &#8226; ease and speed of adoption, use, and deployment;  &#8226; product innovation;  &#8226; pricing and cost structures;  &#8226; customer experience, including support; and  &#8226; brand awareness and reputation.  While we believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors, as well as with software developed by customers internally, based on these competitive factors, some of our competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger customer bases; larger sales and marketing budgets and resources and the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products; broader, deeper, or otherwise more established relationships with technology, channel, and distribution partners and customers; wider geographic presence or greater access to larger potential customer bases; greater focus in specific geographies; lower labor and research and development costs; larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources to provide services, to make acquisitions, and to develop and introduce new products and capabilities.  Intellectual Property  We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, contractual provisions, and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights.  We seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business through patent protection in the United States and abroad; however, we are not dependent on any particular patent or application for the operation of our business.  In addition, we have registered &#8220;Palantir&#8221; as a trademark in the United States and other jurisdictions. We also have registered trademarks for &#8220;Gotham,&#8221; &#8220;Palantir Foundry,&#8221; and our corporate logo, and are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include &#8220;Palantir,&#8221; including, most importantly, &#8220;Palantir.com.&#8221;  In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into proprietary information and invention assignment agreements or similar agreements with our employees, consultants, and contractors. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights through provisions in our agreements with customers.  Seasonality  We generally experience seasonality in the timing of recognition of revenue as a result of the timing of the execution of our contracts and, to a lesser extent, the existence of certain acceptance criteria, as we have historically executed many of our contracts in the third and fourth quarters due to the fiscal year ends and procurement cycles of our customers and at times we may start work prior to finalizing such contracts. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Seasonality may cause fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position.&#8221;  Employees and Human Capital  Our employees are critical to the success of our business. As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,838 full-time employees, including 1,436 employees employed outside of the United States. We also engage part-time employees, independent contractors, and third-party personnel to supplement our workforce.  Other than our employees in France, who are represented by a works council, none of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages due to employee disputes, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.  Our human capital resources objectives include recruiting, retaining, training, and motivating our personnel. We strive to foster a diverse and inclusive culture and environment which encourages active dialogue and robust engagement on the issues most salient to employee satisfaction and believe our employees are empowered to play a significant role in shaping the direction and success of the company. One avenue for employees to contribute their voices is through Affinity Groups: employee-led resource groups that celebrate unique perspectives and backgrounds and help guide our Diversity, Equity &#38; Inclusion (&#8220;DEI&#8221;) business initiatives. We also conduct regular company-wide surveys to assess the sentiment toward our values and culture, and our employees&#8217; well-being and overall health. These surveys allow Palantir to get actionable feedback and drive awareness, discussion, and change.  Diversity, Equity, &#38; Inclusion  To achieve our best outcomes, Palantir needs people who bring a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences. Our DEI team takes the lead in working to increase awareness and accountability and promote active allyship throughout Palantir. We acknowledge that each member of our increasingly diverse community has their own needs, experiences, and opportunities.
