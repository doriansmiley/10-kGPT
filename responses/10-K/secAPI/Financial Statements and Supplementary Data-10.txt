The Company performs an assessment of both positive and negative evidence, including its earnings history and results of recent operations, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. The Company reviews the recognition of deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  realization of such assets is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. The Company maintains a full valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.  Provisions enacted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental (&#8220;R&#38;E&#8221;) expenditures became effective on January 1, 2022. Beginning January 1, 2022, all U.S. and non-U.S. based R&#38;E expenditures must be capitalized and amortized over five years and 15 years, respectively. Beginning January 1, 2022, the Company began capitalizing and amortizing R&#38;E expenditures over five years for domestic research and 15 for international research rather than expensing these costs as incurred. As a result, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $ 70.8 million related to the capitalization requirement.  The valuation allowance totaled $ 2.1 billion and $ 2.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets increased by $ 74.1 million and $ 757.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  As of December 31, 2022, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating losses of approximately $ 5.6 billion and $ 2.8 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating losses of approximately $ 5.9 billion and $ 2.9 billion, respectively. The U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2024 through 2037 if not utilized, with the exception of $ 1.4 billion which can be carried forward indefinitely. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2023 through 2041 if not utilized.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal and California research and development credits of approximately $ 230.2 million and $ 91.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had federal and California research and development credits of approximately $ 184.1 million and $ 68.7 million, respectively. The federal research and development credits will begin to expire in the years 2027 through 2041 if not utilized and the California research and development credits have no expiration date. Utilization of the net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership percentage change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards before utilization.  As of December 31, 2022, the Company had net operating losses in the United Kingdom of approximately $ 303.4 million. The U.K. net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely.  As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an immaterial amount of earnings from its wholly-owned non-U.S. subsidiaries indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The Company does not intend to repatriate these earnings and, accordingly, the Company does not provide for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding tax on these earnings. The Company recorded $ 6.5 million of deferred tax liability on the outside basis differences in its investment in Palantir Technologies Japan, Kabushiki Kaisha (&#8220;Palantir Japan&#8221;) that is unrelated to unremitted earnings.  On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, implements a 15% minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations, a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. Based on the Company&#8217;s current analysis of the provisions, the Company does not believe this legislation will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

As of December 31, 2022, no significant increases or decreases are expected to the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions within the next twelve months.  It is the Company&#8217;s policy to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.

The Company files U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitation.

Segment and Geographic Information  The following reporting segment tables reflect the results of the Company&#8217;s reportable operating segments consistent with the manner in which the CODM evaluates the performance of each segment and allocates the Company&#8217;s resources. The CODM does not evaluate the performance of the Company&#8217;s assets on a segment basis for internal management reporting and, therefore, such information is not presented.  Contribution is used, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, each of the segments. A segment&#8217;s contribution is calculated as segment revenue less the related costs of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. It excludes certain operating expenses that are not allocated to segments because they are separately managed at the consolidated corporate level. These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation expense, research and development expenses, and general and administrative expenses.  Financial information for each reportable segment was as follows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Revenue: Government $ 1,071,776 &#160; $ 897,356 &#160; $ 610,198 &#160; Commercial 834,095 &#160; 644,533 &#160; 482,475 &#160; Total revenue $ 1,905,871 &#160; $ 1,541,889 &#160; $ 1,092,673 &#160; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Amount % Amount % Amount % Contribution: Government $ 620,677 &#160; 58 &#160; % $ 541,883 &#160; 60 &#160; % $ 346,937 &#160; 57 &#160; % Commercial 414,496 &#160; 50 &#160; % 357,546 &#160; 55 &#160; % 247,320 &#160; 51 &#160; % Total contribution $ 1,035,173 &#160; 54 &#160; % $ 899,429 &#160; 58 &#160; % $ 594,257 &#160; 54 &#160; % ##TABLE_END
