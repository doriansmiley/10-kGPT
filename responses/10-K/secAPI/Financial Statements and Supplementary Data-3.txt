The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,598,540 &#160; $ 2,290,674 &#160; $ 2,011,323 &#160; Restricted cash 16,244 &#160; 36,628 &#160; 37,285 &#160; Restricted cash, noncurrent 12,551 &#160; 39,612 &#160; 79,538 &#160; Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 2,627,335 &#160; $ 2,366,914 &#160; $ 2,128,146 &#160; ##TABLE_END Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses  Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for credit losses. The Company generally grants non-collateralized credit terms to its customers. Allowance for credit losses is based on the Company&#8217;s best estimate of probable losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio and is determined based on expectations of the customer&#8217;s ability to pay by considering factors such as customer type (commercial or government), historical experience, financial position of the customer, age of the accounts receivable, current economic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and reasonable and supportable forward-looking factors about its portfolio and future economic conditions. Accounts receivable are written-off and charged against an allowance for credit losses when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success. Based upon the Company&#8217;s assessment as of December 31, 2022 the Company recorded an allowance for credit losses of $ 10.1 million. Based upon the Company&#8217;s assessment as of December 31, 2021, the allowances for credit losses were not material.  Concentrations of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds with original maturities of three months or less, which are invested primarily with U.S. financial institutions. Cash deposits with financial institutions, including restricted cash, generally exceed federally insured limits. Management believes minimal credit risk exists with respect to these financial institutions and the Company has not experienced any losses on such amounts.  The Company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable presented on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company&#8217;s accounts receivable balances as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 258.3 million and $ 190.9 million, respectively. No customer represented more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.  For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no customer represented 10% or more of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Customer F, which is in the government operating segment, represented 10 % of total revenue. No other customers represented more than 10% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.  Alternative Investments  Alternative investments include gold bars and are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently remeasured at the lower of cost or market each reporting period. Market value is determined by using quoted market prices of identical or similar assets from active markets. Unrealized losses are recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net upon realization.  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  Property and Equipment, Net  Property and equipment, net are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are generally three years . Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life, which is generally five years . Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the assets are expensed when incurred. Upon sale or retirement of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized.  Privately-held Securities  Equity securities in private-held companies without readily determinable fair values are recorded using the measurement alternative. Such investments are carried at cost, less any impairments, and are adjusted for subsequent observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Changes in the basis of the equity securities are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  Business Combinations  Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 805, Business Combinations, and are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, are measured at fair value on the acquisition date using the appropriate valuation method. Goodwill generated from acquisitions is recognized if the fair value of the purchase consideration transferred, or the fair value of the acquirer&#8217;s interest in the acquiree if no consideration is transferred, and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. In determining the fair value of identifiable assets, we use various valuation techniques which require us to make estimates and assumptions surrounding projected revenues and costs, future growth, and discount rates.  Goodwill  Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration transferred, or the fair value of the acquirer&#8217;s interest in the acquiree if no consideration is transferred, and any noncontrolling interests over the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test. We perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment on the first day of the fourth quarter. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.  Other Intangible Assets  Other intangible assets include finite-lived intangible assets, which mainly consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, and backlog. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment using a similar methodology to our property and equipment, as described below. Other intangible assets are recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not material.  Leases  The Company adopted the Accounting Standard Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2016-02, Leases, and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively &#8220;ASC 842&#8221;), as of January 1, 2020.  The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. An arrangement is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If a lease is identified, classification is determined at lease commencement. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company&#8217;s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate and therefore the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  interest rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment over a similar term. Operating lease right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) assets are based on the corresponding lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before commencement, initial direct costs, and lease incentives. Renewals or early terminations are not accounted for unless the Company is reasonably certain to exercise these options. Operating lease expense is recognized and the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component. The Company elected to use the transition relief package of practical expedients but did not elect to use the hindsight practical expedient in determining a lease term and impairment of ROU assets at the adoption date. For short-term leases, defined as leases with a term of twelve months or less, the Company elected the practical expedient to not recognize an associated lease liability and ROU asset. Lease payments for short-term leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
