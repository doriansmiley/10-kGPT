Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are not material.  Fair Value Measurement  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability, or an exit price, in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  The Company measures fair value based on a three-level hierarchy of inputs, maximizing the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument&#8217;s level within the three-level hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three-level hierarchy of inputs is as follows:  Level 1: Observable inputs such as unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;  Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and  Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. These inputs are based on the Company&#8217;s own assumptions about current market conditions and require significant management judgment or estimation.  Financial instruments consist of money market funds and certificates of deposit included in cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, marketable securities, other assets accounted for at fair value, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. Money market funds, certificates of deposit, and marketable securities are stated at fair value on a recurring basis. Accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.  Revenue Recognition  The Company generates revenue from the sale of subscriptions to access its software in the Company&#8217;s hosted environment, along with ongoing operations and maintenance (&#8220;O&#38;M&#8221;) services (&#8220;Palantir Cloud&#8221;); software licenses, primarily term licenses in the customers&#8217; environments, with ongoing O&#38;M services (&#8220;On-Premises Software&#8221;); and professional services.  In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , the Company recognizes revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for promised goods or services. The Company applies the following five-step revenue recognition model in accounting for its revenue arrangements:  &#8226; Identification of the contract(s) with the customer, including whether collectability of the consideration is probable by considering the customers&#8217; ability and intention to pay;  &#8226; Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;  &#8226; Determination of the transaction price;  &#8226; Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and  &#8226; Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  Each of the Company&#8217;s significant performance obligations and the Company&#8217;s application of ASC 606 to its revenue arrangements is discussed in further detail below.  Palantir Cloud  The Company&#8217;s Palantir Cloud subscriptions grant customers the right to access the software functionality in a hosted environment controlled by Palantir and are sold together with stand-ready O&#38;M services, as further described below. The Company promises to provide continuous access to the hosted software throughout the contract term. Revenue associated with Palantir Cloud subscriptions is generally recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis, which is consistent with the transfer of control of the Palantir Cloud subscription to the customer.  On-Premises Software  Sales of the Company&#8217;s software licenses, primarily term licenses, grant customers the right to use functional intellectual property, either on their internal hardware infrastructure or on their own cloud instance, over the contractual term and are also sold together with stand-ready O&#38;M services. The O&#38;M services include critical updates, support, and maintenance services required to operate the software and, as such, are necessary for the software to maintain its intended utility over the contractual term. Because of this requirement, the Company has concluded that the software licenses and O&#38;M services, which together the Company refers to as On-Premises Software, are highly interdependent and interrelated and represent a single distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract. Revenue is generally recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis.  Professional Services  The Company&#8217;s professional services support the customers&#8217; use of the software and include, as needed, on-demand user support, user-interface configuration, training, and ongoing ontology and data modeling support. Professional services contracts typically include the provision of on-demand professional services for the duration of the contractual term. These services are typically coterminous with a Palantir Cloud subscription or the On-Premises Software. Professional services are on-demand, whereby the Company performs services throughout the contract period; therefore, the revenue is recognized over the contractual term.  Contract Liabilities  The timing of customer billing and payment relative to the start of the service period varies from contract to contract; however, the Company bills many of its customers in advance of the provision of services under its contracts, resulting in contract liabilities consisting of either deferred revenue or customer deposits (&#8220;contract liabilities&#8221;). Deferred revenue represents billings under noncancelable contracts before the related product or service is transferred to the customer. Customer deposits consist of amounts billed and/or paid in advance of the start of the contractual term or for anticipated revenue generating activities for the portion of a contract term that is subject to cancellation by our customers. Many of the Company&#8217;s arrangements include terms that allow the customer to terminate the contract for convenience and receive a pro-rata refund of the amount of the customer deposit for the period of time remaining in the contract term after the applicable termination notice period expires. In these arrangements, the Company concluded there are no enforceable rights and obligations after such notice period and therefore the consideration received or due from the customer that is subject to termination for convenience is recorded as customer deposits.  The payment terms and conditions vary by contract; however, the Company&#8217;s terms generally require payment within 30 to 60 days from the invoice date. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of payment, the Company elected to apply the practical expedient in accordance with ASC 606 to not adjust contract consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when promised goods and services are transferred to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods and services will be one year or less. As such, the Company determined its contracts do not generally contain a significant financing component.  Areas of Judgment and Estimation  The Company&#8217;s contracts with customers can include multiple promises to transfer goods or services to the customer. Determining whether promises are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately &#8211; or not distinct within the context of the contract and, thus, accounted for together &#8211; requires significant judgment. The Company concluded that the promise to provide a software license is highly interdependent and interrelated with the promise to provide O&#38;M services and such promises are not distinct within the context of its contracts and are accounted for as a single performance obligation as the Company&#8217;s On-Premises Software.  Additionally, the pricing of the Company&#8217;s contracts is generally fixed; however, it is possible for contracts to include variable consideration, which can be based on subjective or objective criteria. The Company includes the estimated amount of variable  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  consideration that it expects to receive to the extent it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur. Variable consideration received was not material in the periods presented.  Costs to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts  Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition of contracts, including sales commissions, and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The Company recognizes a contract cost asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year. Costs to obtain contracts were not material in the periods presented.  The Company recognizes an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a customer if the costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. Costs to fulfill contracts were not material in the periods presented.  Software Development Costs  The Company evaluates capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. Based on the Company&#8217;s product development process and substantial development risks, technological feasibility is established for the Company&#8217;s products when they are made available for general release. Accordingly, the Company has charged all such costs to research and development expense in the period incurred.
