Overview  We build software that empowers organizations to effectively integrate their data, decisions, and operations at scale.  We were founded in 2003 and started building software for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations. We later began working with commercial enterprises, who often faced fundamentally similar challenges in working with data.  We have built three principal software platforms, Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo. Gotham and Foundry enable institutions to transform massive amounts of information into an integrated data asset that reflects their operations. For over a decade, Gotham  has surfaced insights for global defense agencies, the intelligence community, disaster relief organizations and beyond. Foundry is becoming a central operating system not only for individual institutions but also for entire industries. Apollo, which we began offering as a commercial solution in 2021, is a cloud-agnostic, single control layer that coordinates ongoing delivery of new features, security updates, and platform configurations, helping to ensure the continuous operation of critical systems. Apollo allows our customers to run their software in virtually any environment.  While our focus in the short term remains on making our principal software platforms available to increasingly broad swaths of the market, we are also working to identify additional component parts and products embedded within those platforms that have potential as commercial offerings on their own.  We believe that every institution faces challenges that our platforms and products were designed to address. Our approach with all our clients is to establish a partnership that transforms the way they use data in pursuit of their goals.  We regularly evaluate partnerships and investment opportunities in complementary businesses, employee teams, technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our product and service offerings.  Our Business  Our customers pay us to use the software platforms we have built. While we generally offer contract terms of one to five years in length, our customers sometimes enter into shorter-term contracts. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Many of our customer contracts contain termination for convenience provisions.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated $1.9 billion in revenue, reflecting a 24% growth rate from the year ended December 31, 2021, when we generated $1.5 billion in revenue.  In the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred losses from operations of $161.2 million, or adjusted income from operations of $420.8 million when excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes. In the year ended December 31, 2021, our losses from operations were $411.0 million, or adjusted income from operations of $473.5 million when excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes.  In the year ended December 31, 2022, our gross profit was $1.5 billion, reflecting a gross margin of 79%, or 81% when excluding stock-based compensation. In the year ended December 31, 2021, our gross profit was $1.2 billion, reflecting a gross margin of 78%, or 82% when excluding stock-based compensation.  For more information about our adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes; and gross profit and gross margin, when excluding stock-based compensation; as well as reconciliations from loss from operations and gross profit, see the section titled &#8220;Non-GAAP Reconciliations&#8221; below.  Our Customers  We define a customer as an organization from which we have recognized revenue during the trailing twelve-month period. During the period ended December 31, 2022, we had 367 customers, including companies in various commercial sectors and government agencies around the world. During the period ended December 31, 2021, we had 237 customers.  For large government agencies, where a single institution has multiple divisions, units, or subsidiary agencies, each such division, unit, or subsidiary agency that enters into a separate contract with us and is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. For example, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Institutes of Health are subsidiary agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, we treat each of those agencies as a separate customer given that the governing structures and procurement processes of each agency are independent.  We have built lasting and significant customer relationships and partnerships with some of the world&#8217;s leading government institutions and companies. As of December 31, 2022, we expect to generate revenue under our existing customer contracts for an additional 2.8 years on a dollar-weighted average contract duration basis. Dollar-weighted average contract duration represents the length of time we expect to generate revenue on average, including existing contractual obligations and assuming that our customers will exercise all of the contractual options available to them, and is subject to change as we enter into new contracts or if customers terminate for convenience. We calculate this duration on a dollar-weighted basis to adjust for smaller deals. The timing of our customer billings and receipt of payments varies from contract to contract. Our average revenue for the top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2022 was $49.4 million, which grew 13% from an average of $43.6 million in revenue from the top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2021, demonstrating our expanding relationships with existing customers.  Organizations in the commercial and government sectors face similar challenges when it comes to managing data, and we intend to expand our reach in both markets moving forward. Our decisions about which customer relationships require further investment may change over time, based on our assessment of the potential long-term value that our software can generate for them. We enter into initial pilots with customers, generally at our own expense and without a guarantee of future returns, in order to access a unique set of opportunities that others may pass over for lack of resources and shorter investment horizons. We manage customers at the account level, not by industry or sector, so that we can optimize on the specific growth opportunities for each customer. In the year ended December 31, 2022, 56% of our revenue came from government customers and 44% came from commercial customers.  Our U.S. customers have been a meaningful source of revenue growth for our business. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 61% of our revenue from customers in the United States and the remaining 39% from non-U.S. customers. Revenue from our U.S. customers during the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2022 was $1.2 billion, which grew 32% from the prior twelve-month period. We expect that U.S. customers will continue to be a source of significant revenue growth for us.  We continue to believe that our government customers remain a meaningful and resilient source of revenue for our business, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. However, large government customers, in particular, are generally subject to a number of uncertainties regarding budgets and spending levels, changes in timing and spending priorities, and regulatory and policy changes, which can make it difficult to predict when, or if, we will make sales to such customers or the size and scope of any contract awards.

Expansion of Access to Platforms  The speed with which our platforms can be deployed has significantly expanded the range of potential customers with which we plan on partnering over the long term. We anticipate that our reach among an increasingly broad set of customers, in both the commercial and government sectors, will accelerate moving forward. We believe that, as these new partners grow, we will grow with them.
