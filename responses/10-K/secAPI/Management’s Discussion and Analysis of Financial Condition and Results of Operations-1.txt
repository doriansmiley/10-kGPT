We have also made a number of investments in companies whose businesses rely on the ability of their organizations to manage and analyze data effectively at scale.  Our proximity to these businesses and the industries in which they are operating has enhanced, and is expected to continue enhancing, our own product and business development efforts, as we continue expanding access to our platforms to the broadest possible set of customers.  Total Remaining Deal Value  We are focused on building strategic relationships with, and delivering significant outcomes for, our customers over the long term. Our contracts with our customers reflect that long-term orientation, often lasting for multiple years at a time.  Total remaining deal value is the total remaining value of contracts that have been awarded by our government and commercial customers and includes existing contractual obligations and unexercised contract options available to those customers. Total remaining deal value presumes the exercise of all contract options and no termination of contracts; however, the majority of our contracts are subject to termination provisions, including for convenience, and there can be no guarantee that contracts are not terminated or that contract options will be exercised. Total remaining deal value also includes remaining contract value from Strategic Commercial Contracts, which are subject to termination for cause provisions. Total remaining deal value excludes all or some portion of the value of certain commercial contracts as a result of our ongoing assessments of customers&#8217; financial condition, including the consideration of such customers&#8217; ability and intention to pay, and whether such contracts continue to meet the criteria for revenue recognition, among other factors.  As of December 31, 2022, the total remaining deal value of the contracts, as defined above, was $3.7 billion, down 3% from December 31, 2021, when our total remaining deal value of such contracts was $3.8 billion.  Of our total remaining deal value, as of December 31, 2022, the total remaining deal value of the contracts that we entered into with commercial customers, including existing contractual obligations and available contractual options, as defined above, was $2.0 billion, down 23% from December 31, 2021, when the total remaining deal value of such contracts was $2.6 billion. The decrease was due to the exclusion of certain contracts, as described above, as well as decreases resulting from the recognition of revenue and renegotiation of a commercial contract.  As of December 31, 2022, the total remaining deal value of the contracts that we had been awarded by government agencies in the United States and allied countries around the world, including existing contractual obligations and contractual options  available to those government agencies, was $1.7 billion, up 37% from December 31, 2021, when the total value of such contracts was $1.2 billion.  When calculating the total remaining deal value of government contracts, we do not include government contracts known as IDIQ contracts, totaling $2.8 billion, as of December 31, 2022, that we have been awarded, but where the funding of such contracts has not yet been determined. The funding of these contracts is not guaranteed.  Many of our government and commercial contracts are subject to termination for convenience provisions. Additionally, the U.S. federal government is prohibited from exercising contract options more than one year in advance. As a result, there can be no guarantee that our customer contracts will not be terminated or that contract options will be exercised.  Macroeconomic Trends  As a corporation with an international presence, we are subject to risks and uncertainties caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, rising inflation and interest rates, monetary policy changes, and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, these macroeconomic impacts have generally disrupted the operations of our customers and prospective customers. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape.  See the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the impact of macroeconomic trends on our business.  COVID-19 Impact  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the global economy. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial conditions or results of operations in future periods remains uncertain, but to date has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate. We have reopened our offices and have allowed business travel and in-person events to resume, while continuing to closely monitor developments around the evolving nature of the pandemic. As such, our travel and office-related expenditures have increased, and may continue to increase moving forward. However, we expect that some of our employees will continue to work remotely. The economic effects of the pandemic and resulting societal changes are currently not predictable.  The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear to many of our customers that accommodating the extended timelines ordinarily required to realize results from implementing new software solutions is not an option during a crisis. As a result, customers are increasingly adopting our software, which can be ready in days, over internal software development efforts, which may take months or years.  Russia-Ukraine Conflict  We continue to closely monitor the impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and its global impacts on our business. While the conflict is still evolving and the outcome remains highly uncertain, we do not expect that the Russian invasion will have a material impact on our business and results of operations. We do not currently have office locations in Russia and none of our revenues came from sales to entities headquartered in Russia. In June 2022, our Chief Executive Officer, Alexander Karp, met with the President of Ukraine and other senior officials to discuss opening an office in Ukraine and providing ongoing support. Our current operations related to Ukraine are not material to our financial position or results of operations. However, if the conflict continues or worsens, leading to greater disruptions and uncertainty within the technology industry or global economy, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.  Foreign Currency Exchange Rates  Exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations due to a number of factors, including interest rate changes and political and economic uncertainty which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial position.  Our contracts with customers are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and GBP) had an unfavorable impact on our revenues from certain non-U.S. customers; however, that impact for the year ended December 31, 2022 was not material to our financial position or results of operations.  Customer Impacts  Current macroeconomic conditions may also adversely impact our customers&#8217; business, particularly our early- and growth-stage customers. Relationships with early- or growth-stage customers carry inherent risks because, among other things, such customers may be unable to generate sufficient revenues or profitability or to access any necessary financing or funding in a timely manner or on favorable terms to them in the current macroeconomic environment, which has impacted, and may continue to impact, our expected revenue and collections. As a result, current macroeconomic conditions may continue to impact our ability to realize the full value of our commercial contracts with such early- or growth-stage customers. For additional information see Note 4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements in the consolidated financials statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Key Business Measure  In addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key non-GAAP business measure to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions.  Contribution Margin  We believe that the revenue we generate relative to the costs we incur in order to generate such revenue is an important measure of the efficiency of our business. We define contribution margin as revenue less our cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, divided by revenue.  Revenue is allocated to each customer account directly. The cost of revenue and sales and marketing costs include both the costs associated with the deployment and operation of our software as well as expenses associated with identifying new customers and expanding partnerships with existing ones. Our software engineers working with existing customers often manage the deployment and operation of our platforms as well as identify new ways that those platforms can be used. To calculate the contribution by segment, we allocate cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, to an account pro rata based on headcount and time spent on the account during the period. To the extent certain costs or personnel are not directly assigned to a specific account, they are allocated pro rata based on total headcount staffed during such period. Direct costs, such as third-party cloud hosting services, are directly allocated to the account to which they relate. Allocated revenues and expenses are then aggregated into a segment based upon the customer account to which they relate.
