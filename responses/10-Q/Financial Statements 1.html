The net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash is a strong positive indicator for potential investors. Additionally, despite a decrease in net cash used in investing activities compared to the previous year, there was still significant investment in activities such as product development and research. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities, in particular, proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, is also a positive sign. Furthermore, the concentration of credit risk surrounding accounts receivable seems to be mitigated by the Company's portfolio of customers, with no single customer representing more than 17% of total accounts receivable as of September 30, 2022. The Company's remaining performance obligations were $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2022, implying there is significant contracted revenue yet to be recognized. Overall, the Company appears to be in a strong financial position.</body></html>
