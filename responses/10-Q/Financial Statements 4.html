The increase in RSUs granted and outstanding stock-based compensation expenses indicate the company's increasing reliance on equity-based compensation to retain employees. This may be a negative signal to potential investors.

The provision for income taxes also decreased, and the company has maintained a full valuation allowance on its U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets due to the weight of objectively verifiable negative evidence. This suggests that the company's future taxable income may be uncertain or inadequate, which can impact its ability to meet future tax obligations and is also a negative signal.

While the revenue and contribution for both government and commercial sectors have increased compared to the same periods in 2021, the company is still incurring losses from operations, which is a negative signal to potential investors.</body></html>
