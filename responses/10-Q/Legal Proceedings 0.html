The information provided indicates that the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. The company believes that the potential losses from these legal proceedings will not materially impact its business or financial condition. However, there is still a possibility of an unfavorable outcome which could affect the company's future business or financial condition.
