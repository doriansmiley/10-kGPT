Score: Above average

Summary: The adjusted income from operations increased in Q3 2022 in comparison to the same period last year, which is a positive sign for potential investors. The revenue has also increased in both the Government and Commercial segments. However, there was a significant net loss for the period, which would be a negative sign for investors. The cost of revenue and operating expenses also increased, which could be a concern, but this is expected as revenue increases. Overall, the company's performance is above average for a high growth company.</body></html>
