The information presented in the filings indicates positive growth in revenue year over year for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily driven by increased revenue from government and commercial customers. The company has also seen gross profit increase year over year with a gross margin of 77% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 78% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, indicating improved efficiency in supporting revenue growth. However, cost of revenue has also increased due to increased headcount and other expenses. Operating expenses have also increased year over year, mainly driven by increases in payroll, travel and office-related costs, but partially offset by decreases in stock-based compensation expense. Overall, the positive revenue growth and gross profit increase indicate that the company's products and services are gaining adoption among its customers, which bodes well for its future growth prospects.</body></html>
