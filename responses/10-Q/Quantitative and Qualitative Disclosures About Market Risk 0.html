The disclosure presents several market risks associated with the company's investments, interest rates, foreign exchange, and inflation. The company's investment portfolio consists of early or growth-stage companies that have a minimal public trading history, and the fair value of these investments may fluctuate depending on Investees' financial outcome and prospects and global market conditions, including recent and ongoing volatility related to COVID-19 pandemic and rising interest rates. The company has recorded net unrealized losses of $192.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, related to marketable securities, which may cause additional volatility to its financial statements. The disclosure also states that the company has not been exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material to its financial statements. However, the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may subject the company's results of operations and cash flows to fluctuations, particularly changes in the Euro and GBP. Finally, the company does not anticipate inflation to have a material effect on its business, results of operations, or financial condition, but higher costs due to significant inflationary pressures may harm its business, financial condition, or results of operations. Overall, this disclosure presents several significant market risks that may affect the company's financial statements, and it presents a negative outlook to a potential investor. Therefore, the rating is Negative, and the Score is Below Average.</body></html>
