The risk factors identified in the 10-Q are significant and highlight the challenges that the company faces, which could adversely affect its ability to generate profits and succeed in its market. The company has incurred losses each year and the costs of revenue and operating expenses are expected to continue to increase. The company's revenue growth rate may decline and sales efforts involve considerable time, expense, and unpredictability. Additionally, the company faces intense competition, legal and regulatory risks, and dependence on third-party technology, among other risks. This suggests that the company has a below-average performance compared to an average high-growth company, and investors should carefully consider the risks before making an investment decision.</body></html>
