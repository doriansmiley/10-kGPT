The extracted page raises several concerns affecting the business, and consequently the investor's decision. First, the company's success largely depends on enterprise customers whose purchasing decisions are influenced by factors that are often beyond the platform's features, such as economic conditions and budgetary constraints. Secondly, the business heavily relies on a few customers for revenue, and the renewal of customer relationships is not guaranteed, leading to a decline in revenue in case of reduced spending levels or termination of agreements. Thirdly, the contracts offered to customers are often short-term, and there is no obligation to renew, making it difficult for the company to predict future revenue. Fourthly, the company typically closes a large portion of its sales towards the end of a quarter, impacting the financial and cash flow planning. All these factors, coupled with the fluctuation of quarterly results and the potential for revenue from customer contracts to fall below expectations, make investing in the company risky.</body></html>
