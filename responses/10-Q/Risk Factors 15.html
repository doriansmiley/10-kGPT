Summary: 
The filing highlights the potential impact of privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations on the company's business, which may require them to modify their data processing practices and policies and incur substantial costs and expenses to maintain compliance. The complexity of the legal regimes around the world pose a compliance challenge that could result in damages or liability, fines, and lawsuits, and adversely affect the business. The company's non-U.S. sales and operations also expose them to additional risks and regulations that can adversely affect their results of operations, including increased costs, longer payment cycles, and difficulties in enforcing contracts or collecting accounts receivable in emerging markets, among others. These factors could result in limited growth, lower sales productivity, and increased costs and liabilities for the company.</body></html>
