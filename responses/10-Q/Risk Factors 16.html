The information provided in the extracted page shows several risks to the company's non-U.S. operations, such as compliance with foreign laws and regulations, unfair competition, geopolitical instability, currency exchange rate fluctuations, communication/integration issues, tax consequences, and interruptions to business operations. The risks increase the company's cost of doing business, and failure to comply with the regulations and laws may subject the company to investigation, sanctions, fines, penalties, or legal actions, leading to financial losses and damage to the company's reputation. The company is expanding into foreign markets that may place restrictions on data transfer and encryption technology, further increasing the risks. Additionally, the company is subject to regulation by different governments with more stringent requirements, and noncompliance with these requirements can lead to investigations, sanctions, and other consequences. Moreover, the company is involved in legal, regulatory, and administrative inquiries and proceedings that can be expensive, time-consuming, and divert the company's resources and leadership's attention from primary business operations. These risks negatively affect the investor's perspective, and the score for the company's performance is below average.</body></html>
