Score: Below average

The information provided in this section of the filing suggests that the company is exposed to significant risks related to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, as well as to governmental trade controls and economic sanctions. The company operates in countries with developing economies where corruption is more common, which increases the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by employees or third-party business partners. Violations of these laws may result in adverse media coverage, investigations, and significant legal fees, among other liabilities, which would negatively affect the company's business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects. Moreover, compliance with export control and sanctions regulations may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities, limiting the company's ability to compete in certain markets. The score is below average as these risks could have a significant impact on the company's financial performance.</body></html>
