Summary: The information from the SEC filing indicates risks associated with the company's business, particularly in the area of government procurement policies. Increased competition and budgetary pressures could make it difficult to maintain financial performance and customer relationships. The U.S government's decision to procure non-commercial developmental services instead of commercial products could impact future revenue. Any change or repeal of FASA, or a contrary interpretation of FASA by a court of competent jurisdiction, would adversely affect the company's competitive position for U.S. federal government contracts. Finally, the public trading price of the company's Class A common stock may be volatile and could decline regardless of the company's operating performance.</body></html>
