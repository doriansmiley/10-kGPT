Summary: The company's provisions in their amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage certain types of transactions, which could limit the opportunity for investors to receive a premium for their shares of Class A common stock. In addition, the company's multiple class structure of common stock concentrates voting power with certain stockholders, effectively eliminating an investor's ability to influence important transactions such as a change in control. The lack of ability to influence important transactions and the lack of payment of dividends in the foreseeable future may lower the trading price and trading volume of the company's Class A common stock.</body></html>
