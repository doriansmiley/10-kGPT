| Negative | Below Average |

Summary: 

The information provided in this excerpt is negative for potential investors. The founders of the company hold a concentrated voting power and control a significant portion of the voting power of the capital stock. The Founder Voting Trust Agreement and Founder Voting Agreement concentrate the voting power with the founders and effectively eliminate any ability for investors to influence the outcome of important transactions. Additionally, new issuances of common stock in the future will not dilute the voting power of the founders, leading to a potential separation between voting power and economic interests that could cause conflicts of interest between the founders and other stockholders. As a result, this governance structure could limit the likelihood of an unsolicited merger, proxy contest, or sale of shares at a premium over market prices, and could make it harder to replace directors and management. Based on an average high growth company, the score is below average due to the potential negative impact on investor influence and potential for conflicts of interest.</body></html>
