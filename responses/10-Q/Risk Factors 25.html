Summary: 

- The provisions related to the voting power of the Class F common stock may have an adverse effect on stockholders other than the founders, and their challenge may cause delays in the certification of any vote. 
- The multi-class structure of common stock and Founder Voting Trust Agreement and Founder Voting Agreement by which founders exercise control may exist for the foreseeable future, and even if Class F common stock converts to Class B common stock, founders collectively control a significant portion of the voting power. 
- The governance structure may negatively affect the decision by certain institutional investors to purchase or hold shares of Class A common stock, and the multi-class capital structure may make the company ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, which may depress its valuation compared to other similar companies that are included. 
- Adverse economic conditions or reduced technology spending may adversely impact the business, and such conditions could cause customers to defer, reduce, or forego purchases of platforms or services. 
- Natural disasters and other catastrophic events beyond the company's control could harm its business operations and financial condition.</body></html>
