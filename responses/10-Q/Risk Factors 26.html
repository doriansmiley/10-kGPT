The information presented in the filing is negative to potential investors. The company highlights the potential risks associated with maintaining effective control over financial reporting and internal controls. The requirements of the Exchange Act, Sarbanes-Oxley Act and NYSE listing standards are cited as likely to increase legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs. These risks could result in the inability to meet reporting obligations, restatements of financial statements, loss of investor confidence, and a decline in the market price of Class A common stock. The company acknowledges that it has limited personnel and resources to address internal control-related procedures and requires the integration of new technological systems. As a result of compliance with laws and regulations affecting public companies, legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs have increased and will continue to increase, making some activities more time-consuming and costly. Changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure increase legal and financial compliance costs and create uncertainty for public companies. These risks could result in more expensive director and officer liability insurance, reduced policy limits and coverage, or substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. The disclosure of information in public filings may increase the risk of threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. Additionally, the company may face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.</body></html>
