The information provided in the extracted page of the 10-Q and 10-K filings appears to be negative to a potential investor due to several reasons that highlight the risks and challenges faced by the company. Firstly, the company's decision to avoid the Chinese market may limit its growth prospects and could adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition. Secondly, joint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, and strategic alliances may have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations, and prospects due to several risks and challenges associated with such arrangements. The company expects to continue entering into such arrangements as part of its long-term business strategy. Thirdly, if the company is not successful in executing its sales strategy, its results of operations may suffer, particularly in large enterprises and government entities where the sales cycle is typically lengthy and complex, and there are several risks and challenges associated with such sales. Therefore, considering the risks and challenges highlighted in the extracted page, the score is below average for an average high growth company.</body></html>
