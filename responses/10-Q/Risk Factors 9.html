Summary:

The company warns that its ability to secure financing may be impaired, and that additional equity or debt financing may not be available on favorable terms. This could hinder their ability to develop new products, expand their organizations, recruit and retain employees, respond to competitive pressures, or pursue investment opportunities. Furthermore, their debt agreements contain operating and financial restrictions, and a violation of these covenants could result in a default in their credit facility or instruments governing future indebtedness. While they are currently in compliance with all covenants and restrictions associated with their credit facility, the variable rate indebtedness incurred under the credit facility will expose them to interest rate risk. Lastly, their acquisition, investment or business relationship may bring unforeseen risks, operating difficulties, and expenditures, including additional dilution to stockholders, adverse tax consequences, intellectual property claims and disputes, and the potential for disruption, diversion of resources, and unfavorable public perception.</body></html>
