The information provided in ITEM 2 is neutral as it simply states that there were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the period covered by the filing. This information does not provide any insight into the performance of the company's operations or financials, and is not likely to have a significant impact on a potential investor's decision-making process. Therefore, the score is average, based on the assumption of an average high growth company.</body></html>
