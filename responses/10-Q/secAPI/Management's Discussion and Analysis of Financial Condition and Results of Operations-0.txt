 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations, and beliefs, involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. You should review the section titled &#8220;Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; for a discussion of forward-looking statements and the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.  Overview  We build software that empowers organizations to effectively integrate their data, decisions, and operations at scale.  We were founded in 2003 and started building software for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations. We later began working with commercial enterprises, who often faced fundamentally similar challenges in working with data.  We have built three principal software platforms, Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo. Gotham and Foundry enable institutions to transform massive amounts of information into an integrated data asset that reflects their operations. For over a decade, Gotham has surfaced insights for global defense agencies, the intelligence community, disaster relief organizations and beyond. Foundry is becoming a central operating system not only for individual institutions but also for entire industries. Apollo, which we began offering as a commercial solution in 2021, is a cloud-agnostic, single control layer that coordinates ongoing delivery of new features, security updates, and platform configurations, helping to ensure the continuous operation of critical systems. Apollo allows our customers to run their software in virtually any environment.  In addition to the investments we have made in our platforms, we plan to continue to expand our ability to sell our subscriptions globally by investing in resources to address the business needs of local markets, including by increasing our sales and marketing functions and activities, expanding our ecosystem of service partners to support local deployments, and investing in personnel to support our growing customer base and product offerings.  We believe that every institution faces challenges that our platforms were designed to address. Our focus in the near term is to build partnerships with institutions that have the leadership necessary to effect structural change within their organizations &#8212; to reconstitute their operations around data. Over the long term, we believe that every institution in the markets we serve is a potential partner.  We regularly evaluate partnerships and investment opportunities in complementary businesses, employee teams, technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our product and service offerings. For example, we have approved and entered into strategic investments pursuant to certain approved agreements (&#8220;Investment Agreements&#8221;) to purchase shares of various entities, including special purpose acquisition companies and/or other privately-held or publicly-traded entities (each, an &#8220;Investee,&#8221; and such purchases, the &#8220;Investments&#8221;). See further discussion in Note 4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements .  Our Business  Our customers pay us to use the software platforms we have built. While we generally offer contract terms of one to five years in length, our customers sometimes enter into shorter-term contracts. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Many of our customer contracts contain termination for convenience provisions.  For the three months ended September 30, 2022, we generated $477.9 million in revenue, reflecting a 22% growth rate from the three months ended September 30, 2021, when we generated $392.1 million in revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we generated $1.4 billion in revenue, reflecting a 26% growth rate from the nine months ended September 30, 2021, when we generated $1.1 billion in revenue.  In the three months ended September 30, 2022, we incurred losses from operations of $62.2 million, or generated adjusted income from operations of $81.3 million when excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes. In the three months ended September 30, 2021, we incurred losses from operations of $91.9 million, or generated adjusted income from operations of $116.1 million when excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes. In the nine  Table of contents  months ended September 30, 2022, we incurred losses from operations of $143.4 million, or generated adjusted income from operations of $306.5 million when excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes. In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, our losses from operations were $352.1 million, or generated adjusted income from operations of $349.4 million when excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes.  In the three months ended September 30, 2022, our gross profit was $370.3 million, reflecting a gross margin of 77%, or 80% when excluding stock-based compensation. In the three months ended September 30, 2021, our gross profit was $305.3 million, reflecting a gross margin of 78%, or 82% when excluding stock-based compensation. In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, our gross profit was $1.1 billion, reflecting a gross margin of 78%, or 81% when excluding stock-based compensation. In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, our gross profit was $857.2 million, reflecting a gross margin of 77%, or 82% when excluding stock-based compensation.  For more information about our adjusted income or loss from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes; and gross profit and gross margin, excluding stock-based compensation, as well as reconciliations from loss from operations and gross profit, see the section titled &#8220;Non-GAAP Reconciliations&#8221; below .  Our Customers  We define a customer as an organization from which we have recognized revenue during the trailing twelve-month period. During the period ended September 30, 2022, we had 337 customers, including companies in various commercial sectors and government agencies around the world. During the period ended September 30, 2021, we had 203 customers.  For large government agencies, where a single institution has multiple divisions, units, or subsidiary agencies, each such division, unit, or subsidiary agency that enters into a separate contract with us and is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. For example, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Institutes of Health are subsidiary agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, we treat each of those agencies as a separate customer given that the governing structures and procurement processes of each agency are independent.  We have built lasting and significant customer relationships with some of the world&#8217;s leading government institutions and companies, and are expanding our partnerships with early- and growth-stage companies. Our average revenue for the top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2022 was $47.7 million, which grew 15% from an average of $41.3 million in revenue from the top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2021, demonstrating our expanding relationships with existing customers.  Organizations in the commercial and government sectors face similar challenges when it comes to managing data, and we intend to expand our reach in both markets moving forward. In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, 56% of our revenue came from government customers and 44% came from commercial customers.  Our U.S. customers have been a meaningful source of revenue growth for our business. In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we generated 62% of our revenue from customers in the United States and the remaining 38% from non-U.S. customers. Revenue from our U.S. customers during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2022 was $1.1 billion, which grew 38% from the prior twelve-month period. We expect that U.S customers will continue to be a source of significant revenue growth for us.  We continue to believe that our government customers remain a meaningful and resilient source of revenue for our business, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. However, large government customers in particular are generally subject to a number of uncertainties regarding budgets and spending levels, changes in timing and spending priorities, and regulatory and policy changes, which can make it difficult to predict when, or if, we will make sales to such customers or the size and scope of any contract awards.

Risk Factors&#8221; included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Expansion of Access to Platforms  We have expanded access to our platforms to early- and growth-stage companies, including startups, as we continue our outreach efforts to an increasingly broad swath of the potential market.  The speed with which our platforms can be deployed has significantly expanded the range of potential customers with which we plan on partnering over the long term. We anticipate that our reach among an increasingly broad set of customers, in both the commercial and government sectors, will accelerate moving forward. We believe that, as these new partners grow, we will grow with them.
