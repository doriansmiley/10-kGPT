 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in the value of our investments, interest rates, foreign exchange, and inflation.  Market Risk  As of September 30, 2022, we had outstanding investments in marketable securities valued at $57.3 million. We have sold, and may continue to sell, some or all of our existing Investments. These Investments are often in early- or growth-stage companies that have minimal public trading history; as such the fair value of these Investments may fluctuate depending on the financial outcome and prospects of the Investees, as well as global market conditions including recent and ongoing volatility related to the impacts of COVID-19, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and rising interest rates. Additionally, investing in early- or growth-stage companies carries inherent risks because, among other things, the technologies or products that are being developed by these companies are typically in the early phases and may never materialize or they may not achieve their growth or other business objectives, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our investment in these companies. We record gains or losses as the fair value of these Investments change and as we sell them. We anticipate additional volatility to our condensed consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market prices, and as such gains and losses are realized. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, net unrealized losses of $192.8 million related to marketable securities were recorded in other income (expense), net on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. We do not currently anticipate entering into new Investment Agreements to purchase, or commit to purchase, securities of special purpose acquisition companies.  Interest Rate Risk  Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash consist of cash, certificates of deposit, and money market funds. Our primary investment policy and strategies are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements; however, to a lesser extent we have made and may continue to make investments in early- and growth-stage companies, as disclosed in Note 4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Due to the short-term nature of the financial instruments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates.  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk  Our contracts with customers are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, with the remaining denominated in foreign currencies. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in the United States, United Kingdom, and other European countries. Our results of current and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro and GBP. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material to our condensed consolidated financial statements, and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions.  Inflation Risk  We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
