Summary:

The disclosure controls and procedures of the company are designed to ensure that all required information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the company have evaluated the effectiveness of these controls and procedures and have concluded that they were effective at a reasonable assurance level during the period covered by the report. There were no identified changes in the internal control over financial reporting during the same period that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting. However, the company recognizes the inherent limitations of control systems and would continue to monitor and upgrade its internal controls as necessary or appropriate. Overall, the information appears to be positive for a potential investor, as the company has effective disclosure controls and procedures in place, and is committed to improving as necessary.</body></html>
