Analysis:
The prior litigation that the Company was involved in has been settled, but there are still pending securities class action complaints. Although the Company intends to defend itself thoroughly, there is potentially a significant range of loss that could impact it negatively. The lack of current material legal matters or claims secures the Company somewhat, but the significant value of irrevocable standby letters of credit and guarantees for operating leases, customer contracts, and other guarantees and financing arrangements could have an impact on investors. The warranties and indemnification provisions ensure customer confidence; however, the lack of warranty claims and infringement cases to date does not provide a clear insight into potential future costs. In conclusion, the presence of pending litigation, the significant value of letters of credit and guarantees, and an unknown potential loss from future legal matters impact the Company's score negatively.</body></html>
