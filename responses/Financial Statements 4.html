Analysis:
- The company has a high unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs outstanding of $779.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average service period of three years.
- The company had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $404.6 million for the nine months ended September 2022 which is a decrease of $40.4 million compared to the same period in 2021.
- The provision for income taxes decreased by $0.3 million and increased by $6.8 million from a benefit from income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. This is primarily due to the absence in the current period of the revaluation of the Company's UK deferred tax assets as a result of a change in the UK corporate tax rate enacted in June 2021.
- The company has a full valuation allowance on its US and UK deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2022, which indicates a higher possibility that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
- The loss from operations decreased from $91.9 million to $62.2 million for the three months ended September 2021 and 2022, respectively, but increased for the nine months ended September 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.</body></html>
