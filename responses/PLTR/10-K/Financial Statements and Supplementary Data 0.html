The independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young, has audited the consolidated financial statements of Palantir Technologies Inc. and issued an unqualified opinion stating that the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company and the results of its operations and cash flows in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. They also audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting and issued an unqualified opinion stating that Palantir Technologies Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The auditing process required significant judgment, especially regarding revenue recognition, and Ernst & Young conducted thorough testing and evaluation of the financial statements to ensure they were free of material misstatement. Overall, the auditors' opinions indicate that the financial statements are reliable and the Company has effective internal controls in place, which would be positive to a potential investor. However, the high level of judgment required for revenue recognition may indicate complexity in the Company's business model, which could negatively impact the score.</body></html>
