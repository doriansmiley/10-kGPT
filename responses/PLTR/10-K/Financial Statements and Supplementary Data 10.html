Analysis:
- The valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets increased compared to the previous year, indicating a higher likelihood that these assets may not be realized.
- The Company recorded a significant net loss for the year, which may be a concern for potential investors.
- The Company has significant net operating losses that may expire soon, and there is a possibility that utilization of these losses and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership percentage change limitations.
- The Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, which, if recognized, would not benefit the Company's effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance that currently offsets deferred tax assets.
- Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods presented due to their anti-dilutive effect.</body></html>
