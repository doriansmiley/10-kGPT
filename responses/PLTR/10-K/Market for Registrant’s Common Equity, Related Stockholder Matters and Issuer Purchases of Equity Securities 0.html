The information provided in this section does not have a significant impact on an investor's decision. The fact that the Class A common stock is listed on the NYSE could be considered a positive. However, the lack of public trading market for the Class B and F common stock may not be favorable for investors. The number of holders of record of each class of common stock is not significant either. The dividend policy for Common Stock indicates that they have never declared or paid any cash dividend, and they intend to retain their earnings, which may not be attractive to some investors. The Performance Graph is just a comparison of the cumulative total return to stockholders over a specific period and does not provide any insightful information. The absence on Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities is also neutral.</body></html>
