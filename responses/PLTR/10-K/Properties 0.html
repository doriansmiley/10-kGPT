The company's property information provided in the 10-Q filing appears to be neutral to a potential investor. The company has leased principal properties in Denver, Colorado; Palo Alto, California; New York City, New York; and London, England, and also leases various office spaces throughout the world. The company states that it believes its existing facilities are sufficient to meet current requirements and that it will be able to find additional or substitute space as needed for any future expansion. This is a common statement in 10-Q filings and does not provide much insight into the company's financial performance or potential for growth. Overall, this section is not likely to have a significant impact on a potential investor's decision-making process.</body></html>
