The company is exposed to market risks due to fluctuations in the value of their investments, interest rates, foreign exchange, and inflation. The company's investments are in early- or growth-stage companies that have minimal public trading history, which makes the fair value of these investments subject to fluctuation depending on financial outcomes and global market conditions, including recent volatility related to COVID-19 and geopolitical conflicts. Furthermore, investing in early- or growth-stage companies has inherent risks, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of the company's investment. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, significant net unrealized losses and net realized losses related to marketable securities were recorded in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. Although the company's cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting liquidity requirements, the company has made and may continue to make investments in early- and growth-stage companies. The company's contracts with customers are primarily denominated in USD, while their expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in which they conduct operations, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. This means that the company's results of current and future operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro and GBP. Additionally, the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on their business, results of operations, or financial condition, which could harm their business, financial condition, or results of operations if costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures. Based on this information, the rating is negative, and the score is below average.</body></html>
