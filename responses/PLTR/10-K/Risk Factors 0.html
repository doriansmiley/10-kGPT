Summary:

The risk factors section reveals a number of potential issues that investors may want to consider before investing. The company has a history of losses and expects operating expenses to continue increasing, which could impact profitability. The revenue growth rate has declined and may continue to decline due to various factors, including increased competition. Sales efforts are time-consuming and expensive, and the sales cycle is often long and unpredictable. The company's key business measures are likely to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, and seasonality can cause fluctuations in its results of operations. The company's complex platforms require a lengthy implementation process, and it may struggle to develop and deploy new technologies to meet customer needs. Additionally, the business is subject to evolving U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and security, among other issues. Many customer contracts can be terminated at any time for convenience, and the market for the company's platforms and services may develop more slowly than expected. The multi-class structure of the company's common stock, the Founder Voting Trust Agreement, and the Founder Voting Agreement concentrate voting power with certain stockholders, which could impact decision-making. Overall, these risks may adversely affect the company's business, financial condition, and results of operations, potentially leading to a decline in the value of its Class A common stock.</body></html>
