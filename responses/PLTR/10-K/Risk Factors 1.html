Summary:
- The company's sales efforts require an extensive effort throughout a customer's organization, a significant investment of human resources, expense and time, and there can be no assurances that they will be successful in making a sale to a potential customer. 
- Historical reliance on a limited number of customers accounting for a substantial portion of revenue. 
- Increasing the size and number of the deployments of existing customers is a major part of the company's growth strategy, but they may not be effective in executing this or any other aspect of their growth strategy.
- The company may not realize the full deal value of their customer contracts.
- Results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, making it difficult to predict future performance.
- The timing of customer billing and payment varies from contract to contract, and a delay in receipt of collections or a default on a large contract may negatively impact liquidity.</body></html>
