The extracted page from the filing contains information on the potential risks of the company's acquisition activities, as well as risks related to intellectual property, information technology, data privacy, and security. These risks could negatively impact the company's financial position, results of operations, earnings per share, and cash flows, and therefore are rated as negative to a potential investor. The company's assessment of contracts' total value, excluding $262.2 million of the value of certain contracts, could also indicate challenges in generating revenues as a result of investing in companies with novel and unproven technologies, products, and services. The potential occurrence of cybersecurity attacks and threats could result in loss of business, liability, and damage to the company's reputation. Overall, the information presented in this filing raises significant concerns for a potential investor, with a score below average compared to an average high-growth company.</body></html>
