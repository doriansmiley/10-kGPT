The extracted page from the filing highlights the potential cybersecurity threats, which may result in unauthorized access, sabotage, or damage to the Company's systems and operations. The Company acknowledges that it may not be capable of detecting or preventing these cyberattacks or implementing adequate preventative measures. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict further increases the risk of cybersecurity attacks, which may materially disrupt the Company's systems and operations. Additionally, the Company's dependency on computing infrastructure operated by AWS, Microsoft, and other third parties could be detrimental if any errors, disruption, performance problems, or failure occurs in their or the Company's operational infrastructure. The Company has experienced disruptions, failures, data loss, outages, or other performance problems in the past, which may adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations. Lastly, the issues raised by the use of artificial intelligence in the Company's platforms may result in reputational harm or liability, affecting its acceptance and further development, adoption, and use. 

Overall, these factors may increase the Company's expenses, expose it to legal or contractual liability, damage its reputation and brand, impair its ability to manage operations and sales management process, and decline revenue and margins.</body></html>
