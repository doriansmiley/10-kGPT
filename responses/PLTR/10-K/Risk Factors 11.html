The information in this filing indicates significant cybersecurity risks. The company acknowledges that security breaches or incidents may be perpetrated by internal bad actors or by third parties, and that these threats are constantly evolving and increasingly complex and sophisticated. While the company has security measures in place and is continuing to strengthen its threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures, there is no guarantee that past, future, or ongoing cyberattacks or other security breaches or incidents against the company or a third party will not have a material impact on its business or financial results. Furthermore, the company relies on computing infrastructure operated by third parties, such as AWS and Microsoft, and any errors, disruption, performance problems, or failure in their or the company's operational infrastructure could adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations. Overall, these cybersecurity risks indicate a negative outlook for potential investors.</body></html>
