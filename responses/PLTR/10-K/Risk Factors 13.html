There are significant risks to investing in this company due to their vulnerability to intellectual property lawsuits and the potential for errors, defects or bugs in their technology. They may need to direct significant resources towards intellectual property monitoring and protection, which could lead to distraction from business operations. The company has been, and may continue to be, subject to intellectual property rights claims, which can be costly to defend and may limit their ability to use certain technologies. The potential for errors or delays in releasing new software or new versions of platforms could result in revenue loss, service costs, liability for damages and diversion of resources. The company maintains insurance to protect against certain claims associated with their products, but their insurance may not fully protect them from such claims and related liabilities and costs.</body></html>
