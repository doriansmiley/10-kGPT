The information provided in the filing indicates that the company is subject to various local, state, national, and international laws, directives, and regulations related to privacy, data protection, and information security. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant changes, making it challenging for the company to stay compliant. Furthermore, the complexity of laws and regulations pose a compliance challenge that could manifest in significant costs, damages, or liability in other forms as a result of failure to implement proper programmatic controls, or the inadvertent or malicious breach of applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual privacy or data protection requirements. 

Moreover, complying with these laws and regulations may cause the company to incur substantial operational costs or require them to modify their data handling practices on an ongoing basis.

These existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, increase the company's operating costs, or limit their operations. 

Overall, the information presented in the filing suggests that complying with privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations could be challenging and expensive for the company, which could have an adverse impact on their financial performance and operations.</body></html>
