Summary:
The company is facing several legal, regulatory, and administrative inquiries and proceedings that could negatively impact its business, financial condition, and results of operations. The number and significance of legal disputes and inquiries may increase as the company grows larger, expands in employee headcount, scope, and geographic reach, and as its platforms and services become more complex. This could result in negative publicity, which could harm customer and public perception of the business. Furthermore, failure to comply with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws could subject the company to penalties and other adverse consequences. The company's exposure for violating these laws increases as its non-U.S. presence expands and as it increases sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, governmental trade controls, including export and import controls, sanctions, customs requirements, and related regimes, could subject the company to liability or limit its ability to compete in certain markets. Compliance with these regulatory requirements regarding the export of the company's products may create delays in the introduction of its products in non-U.S. markets, prevent its customers with non-U.S. operations from deploying its products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export of its products to some countries altogether. 

Overall, these factors raise concerns about the company's ability to operate efficiently and sustainably in the face of legal and regulatory challenges. As a result, the score for this information is below average.</body></html>
