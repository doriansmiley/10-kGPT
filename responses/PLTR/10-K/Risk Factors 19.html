Summary: The company's dependence on sales to the public sector means that changes in government policies, such as decreases in funding, could negatively impact their business. Furthermore, they face challenges and risks in selling to government agencies, including intense competition and complying with regulations. The company's ability to maintain personnel and facility security clearances is crucial to their work on classified programs, but obtaining and maintaining these clearances can be difficult and time-consuming. The company's contracts with government customers often contain provisions that give the customers additional rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including the ability to terminate contracts for convenience with short notice. 

Overall, these risks and uncertainties associated with the company's reliance on the public sector for revenue, complying with government regulations, and relying on contracts with government customers make their business less attractive to potential investors. Therefore, this information can be seen as negative to a perspective investor with a below-average score.</body></html>
