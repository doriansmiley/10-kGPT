The information provided in the SEC filing indicates that a significant portion of the company's revenue is derived from contracts with government agencies. The success and growth of the business is largely dependent on the procurement of government contracts, which can be highly competitive, expensive, and time-consuming. Furthermore, the company is subject to various laws and regulations relating to the performance and administration of contracts, which can result in adverse events or activities.

The risks associated with the relationship and business with the public sector include changes in fiscal or contracting policies, government budgetary constraints, changes in government programs or applicable requirements, budgetary constraints, changes in political or social attitudes, appeals, disputes or litigation relating to government procurement, among others.

The company's contracts with governments involve classified programs, which may limit investor insight into portions of the business. The company may not be able to bid on or win new classified contracts if it is unable to maintain required personnel and facility security clearances.

Additionally, many of the company's contracts with government customers can be terminated by the customer at any time for convenience, and the contracts often contain provisions with additional rights and remedies favorable to the customers.

Overall, the information provided in the SEC filing highlights significant risks associated with the company's dependence on government contracts and the regulations and policies associated with them. As such, the score for an average high growth company would be below average.</body></html>
