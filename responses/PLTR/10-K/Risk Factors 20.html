The information provided in the extracted page from the filing suggests significant risks associated with the company's contracts with governments and government agencies. The company is subject to protests by competitors, suspension or debarment from doing business with the government, and control or prohibition of export of services. Any termination, cancellation, or non-renewal of significant contracts or failure to comply with laws and regulations could result in material harm to the company's financial condition and results of operations.

The company is also experiencing increased competition and bid protests in a budget-constrained environment, which may limit growth prospects. The U.S. government may procure non-commercial developmental services instead of commercial products, which could materially impact the company's future U.S. government business and revenue. Additionally, a decline in the U.S. and other government budgets or changes in spending or budgetary priorities could significantly and adversely affect the company's future revenue.

Finally, the public trading price of the company's Class A common stock may be volatile and subject to fluctuations in response to various factors beyond the company's control. 

Overall, the risks associated with the company's government contracts and budget constraints suggest a negative outlook to potential investors with a below-average score.</body></html>
