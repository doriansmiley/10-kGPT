The information provided indicates that there are several potential risks to the investor. There is a possibility that competitors could protest the award of contracts, leading to suspension of performance, resubmission of offers or even termination of contracts. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could lead to loss of government customers, penalties and termination of contracts. Evolving government procurement policies could negatively affect profitability, while increased competition and bid protests could affect financial performance. The US government may decide to procure non-commercial developmental items and services instead of commercial items and services, potentially leading to contentious communications or litigation. Additionally, a decline in government budgets or changes in spending priorities could negatively impact revenue and growth prospects. The volatility and fluctuation of the public trading price of Class A common stock may also lead to loss of investment. Overall, it is important for investors to carefully consider these potential risks before investing in the company.
