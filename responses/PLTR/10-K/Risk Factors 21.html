The information presented in this section highlights several factors that could negatively impact the performance of the company. Firstly, the volatile nature of the stock market and technology stock prices could impact the trading prices of the company's common stock. Secondly, the announcement of similar services or platform features by competitors could put pressure on the company's market share. 
Thirdly, litigation and investigations by regulators into the operations of the company or its competitors could lead to substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources. Additionally, the exclusive forum provision contained in the company's amended and restated bylaws may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim to judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with the company or its directors, officers, stockholders, or employees. 
Finally, the potential sale of substantial amounts of the company's Class A common stock into the public market, particularly sales by its directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders, could cause the trading price of its common stock to decline.</body></html>
