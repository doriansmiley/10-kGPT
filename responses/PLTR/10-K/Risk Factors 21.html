The page extracted from the filing contains several factors that could negatively impact a potential investor's decision. The various risks mentioned include fluctuations in the stock market, volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks, changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies, sales or expected sales of shares of Class A common stock by the company or its stockholders, short-selling of Class A common stock, and failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of the company. Moreover, the page includes information about the risks associated with litigation and investigations involving the company, actual or perceived incidents of privacy or security breaches, acquisition-related risks, and changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles, among others. Additionally, the page highlights the risks posed by sales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock in the public market or the perception that sales might occur, and further notes that many holders of outstanding options may elect to exercise such options prior to expiration, subsequently selling their shares. Given the numerous risks outlined, a potential investor may view the information as negative and score it below average.</body></html>
