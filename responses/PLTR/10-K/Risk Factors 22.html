Summary: The information provided in the extracted page from the SEC filing presents several potential risks to investors. The expiration of registration rights and the possibility of issuing new shares could cause volatility in the trading price of the company's Class A common stock. Additionally, the provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for stockholders to cause the company to take certain actions or elect directors of their choosing. The potential for inaccurate or unfavorable research published by securities or industry analysts could also contribute to a decline in the trading price of the company's Class A common stock. Finally, the possibility of becoming a "controlled company" due to the concentration of voting power among the company's founders and their affiliates could result in the company not complying with certain NYSE corporate governance standards. All of these factors increase the risk to investors and contribute to a below-average score.</body></html>
