The information provided suggests that there is a risk of the trading price of Class A common stock declining or being volatile due to the registration of additional shares. There is also a possibility of substantial dilution to existing stockholders from the issuance of capital stocks. The amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may discourage certain types of transactions and make the acquisition of the company more difficult, which could limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of Class A common stock.  Additionally, the control of the voting power among the Founders and their affiliates could result in the company being classified as a "controlled company" under NYSE corporate governance rules, which could lead to the company not complying with certain NYSE corporate governance standards. Finally, if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about the company, its business or its market, or if they change their recommendation regarding Class A common stock adversely, the trading price and trading volume of Class A common stock could decline.</body></html>
