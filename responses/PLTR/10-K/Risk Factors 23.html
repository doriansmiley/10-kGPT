Score: Below-average

Analysis:
- The company does not plan to pay any dividends in the near future and their credit facility has restrictions on dividend payouts.
- Due to the multiple class structure of common stock, the Founders and their affiliates will effectively dominate all matters submitted to the stockholders making it difficult for other investors to have any influence.
- The voting power is concentrated to the Founders, and their affiliates making it challenging for any potential investor to influence any major corporate decisions.
- The Founder Voting Trust Agreement and the Founder Voting Agreement concentrate voting power in the Founders' hands, making it harder for a new investor or board member to bring about any real change. 
- The possibility exists that Founders might modify agreements in a manner adverse to stockholders. 

Overall, based on the above factors affecting the company, it appears negative, and the score given is below average for an average high growth company.</body></html>
