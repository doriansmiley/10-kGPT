The information presented in the filing raises concerns for potential investors. The Founders and their affiliates have the potential to hold an outsized voting power compared to their economic interests, which could lead to conflicts of interest. The option grants to two of the Founders may contribute to them meeting the Ownership Threshold, which is already a small minority of outstanding Corporation Equity Securities. The Designated Founders' Excluded Shares could also increase the relative voting power of certain Founders. All of these factors combined present a potential risk for investors. Therefore, the score is below the average of a high growth company.</body></html>
