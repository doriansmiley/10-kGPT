Based on the information provided in the 10-Q and 10-K filings, the voting power and economic interests of the Founders and their affiliates could cause conflicts of interest between the Founders and other stockholders, potentially resulting in actions that are not desirable for other stockholders. The total voting power of the Founders and their affiliates is currently at approximately 27.1%, but their voting power could increase substantially in the future due to their ability to acquire additional shares of Class A and B common stock. In addition, the Ownership Threshold that must be met on the applicable record date for the Founders and their affiliates is relatively low compared to the number of outstanding Corporation Equity Securities, which could result in an outsized voting power compared to their economic interests. Any future issuances of common stock by the company are not subject to stockholder approval, except as required by the NYSE listing standards. Furthermore, the Designated Founders' Excluded Shares held by Mr. Thiel or his affiliates may have significant voting power compared to other Founders. These factors could have negative implications for potential investors, particularly if the company does not take steps to address potential conflicts of interest.</body></html>
