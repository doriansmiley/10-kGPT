Analysis:
The information provided in the filing suggests that the multi-class structure of the common stock and the Founder Voting Trust Agreement, among other provisions, may negatively affect potential investors. The provisions allow for the Founders to control the voting power of the company, despite only holding a nominal equity interest. In addition, the policies of certain institutional investors may prohibit holding low-voting stock, which could depress the company's valuation compared to other similar companies. Moreover, future issuances of Class A common stock will dilute the voting power of Class A common stockholders, while potentially maintaining or further increasing the Founders' voting power through Class F common stock. These factors suggest a potential negative impact on the return on investment for a potential investor. Therefore, the score is below average for a high-growth company.</body></html>
