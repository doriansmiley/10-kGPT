Explanation: 
The information provided in this section of the filing raises concerns about potential risks and challenges that can negatively affect the company's operations and financial performance. The risks include adverse economic conditions, reduced technology spending, availability of credit, supply chain disruptions, political and economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, volatility in exchange rates, exposure to natural disasters and catastrophic events, and failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls. These risks could result in longer sales cycles, reduced demand for platforms and services, reduced sales growth, lower prices, contract terminations or renegotiations, and increased expenses or liabilities. Additionally, failure to comply with SEC regulations could result in a restatement of financial statements, loss of investor confidence, and negative impact on the trading price of the stock. The overall negative outlook requires potential investors to be cautious and carefully evaluate the risks before investing.</body></html>
