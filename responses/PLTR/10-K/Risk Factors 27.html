This information informs potential investors of the increased costs and demands the company faces in complying with public company regulations. These regulations have increased legal, accounting, finance, and other expenses for the company, and continue to make activities more time consuming and costly. These compliance costs and complexities may distract management from the day-to-day management of the business and harm its financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, changing laws and regulations relating to corporate governance and public disclosure have created uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, making some activities more time-consuming and subject to varying interpretations, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Disclosure of information in filings required by a public company has increased the visibility of the company, which may result in an increased risk of threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties, which could harm its financial condition, and results of operations. All of these factors may have a negative impact on the company's performance, resulting in a below-average score for potential investors.</body></html>
