Analysis:
The information provided in the filing indicates a negative outlook on attracting and retaining skilled personnel. The company may experience difficulty in filling positions in a timely manner or at all, and may have to incur significant costs to attract, train, and retain skilled personnel. The company may also face challenges entering new geographies due to competition with traditional local employers for talent. If the company fails to attract and motivate current personnel capable of meeting their growing technical, operational, and managerial requirements, it may negatively impact their business. The company may also face challenges obtaining security clearances, which could negatively affect their performance on government contracts. 

Additionally, the company may face challenges in effectively building, expanding, and deploying their marketing and sales organization. This could impact their growth and long-term success. The company may also have to invest significant resources in their sales operations to enable their sales organization to run effectively and efficiently. Any future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively affect their rate of growth. 

The ability to sell their platforms and satisfy customers is heavily dependent on the quality of their services. The company needs to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel to support customers on their platforms. The number of their customers has grown significantly, and that growth may put additional pressure on their services teams. The company may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for their O&M services. If the company is unable to provide efficient O&M services globally at scale, their ability to grow their operations may be harmed. 

Overall, the information provided in the filing indicates a negative outlook on attracting and retaining skilled personnel and building a sustainable sales organization, which may negatively impact the growth and long-term success of the company.</body></html>
