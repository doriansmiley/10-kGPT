The information in the extracted page highlights the potential risks the company faces in hiring, training and developing qualified personnel, maintaining and expanding their sales organization, and providing high-quality services to their customers. The company warns that it may face challenges in recruiting and retaining skilled personnel and may incur significant costs in attracting and training employees. The company also faces intense competition for engineering personnel in major US markets where they operate, which may increase their recruitment and retention costs. Moreover, restrictive immigration laws may limit the company's ability to hire personnel outside of the United States. 

The company also faces challenges in building, expanding, and managing their sales operations and organization, which requires significant investments in time, effort and expenses. Their unique sales model may require significant investments and time to train sales personnel, and any restructurings of their sales organization may adversely affect their rate of growth.

Additionally, the company's ability to offer high-quality services is critical to its sales and operation, and their failure to provide effective ongoing services may negatively affect their relationships with their customers. Their O&M services and platforms are deployed in large, complex technology environments, which may put additional pressure on their service teams. The company may also face language and time-zone barriers as they continue to grow their operations and expand outside of the United States.

Overall, these potential risks may negatively affect the company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.</body></html>
