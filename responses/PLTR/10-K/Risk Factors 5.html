Summary: The information provided in the excerpt highlights various risks faced by the company, which could have a detrimental impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects going forward. Some of the risks include the need to maintain high-quality services, as failure to do so could result in negative publicity and a damaged reputation, especially considering the various requirements of large enterprise and government customers. Additionally, unfavorable media coverage, public criticism, and political/social activism could also harm the company's brand and reputation with potential and existing customers, investors, and employees. Furthermore, changes in pricing structures and difficulty in determining the appropriate price structure for its products and services could affect sales revenue, while product-based business model concerns may impact growth. Finally, the timing of revenue recognition may also create challenges for the company in terms of reflecting downturns or upturns in new sales and renewals, which could impact its future periods' financial performance.</body></html>
