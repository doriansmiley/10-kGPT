The information extracted from the filing highlights some risks and challenges that may negatively impact the company's growth prospects and financial performance. The company faces significant competition in its markets, including large enterprise software companies, government contractors, and system integrators. Moreover, it may lack sufficient financial resources to maintain or improve its competitive position. The company may be required to make substantial additional investments in research, development, services, marketing, and sales functions in order to respond to competition, and there can be no assurance that it will be able to compete successfully in the future. Additionally, the company's culture of prioritizing customer outcomes over short-term financial results may produce long-term benefits and results that may be poorly received in the public markets. The company may also not enter into relationships with potential customers whose activities are inconsistent with its organizational mission or values.
