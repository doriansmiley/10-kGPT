The information provided in the filing highlights several risks that the company may face that could negatively impact its growth and financial performance. The company may face significant risks or liabilities due to its agreements with customers that include exclusivity arrangements or unique contractual, pricing, or payment terms. This may limit the company's ability to license its platforms and provide services to specific customers or compete in certain geographic markets and industries. The intense competition in the markets for the company's platforms, which may limit its ability to compete effectively and maintain or improve its competitive position, is also a significant risk. The company may be required to make substantial additional investments in order to respond to competition, and there can be no assurance that it will be able to compete successfully in the future. The risks discussed above, among others highlighted in the filing, may result in fewer customer orders, reduced revenue and margins, and loss of market share, any of which could harm the company's business and results of operations. While the company's culture emphasizes rapid innovation and advancement of successful hires, this may also result in unintended outcomes or in decisions that are poorly received by customers or other stakeholders. The company's culture also prioritizes customer outcomes over short-term financial results, which may not produce the long-term benefits and results that the company expects and may be poorly received in the short term by the public markets, harming the company's customer growth and its business, financial condition, and results of operations. The company's decision to not enter into relationships with potential customers whose activities or values are inconsistent with its mission to support Western liberal democracy and its strategic allies may also limit its growth prospects, business, and results of operations. Overall, the risks highlighted in the filing and the company's culture and values may have a negative impact on the company's growth and financial performance.</body></html>
