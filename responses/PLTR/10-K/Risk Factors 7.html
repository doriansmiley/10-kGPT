The information from the company's SEC filings suggests that their decision to not work with the Chinese Communist Party and not host their platforms in China may limit their growth prospects. The company also acknowledges that joint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, and strategic alliances may present significant challenges and risks to their business, including distracting management from core business activities, exposing them to unexpected liabilities, and limiting their ability to compete in certain markets.

Furthermore, the company notes that entering into these relationships may be subject to government regulation, limiting their ability to carry out their long-term strategy. Additionally, the company's strategy of increasing sales to large enterprises and government entities involves risks such as increased competition, more stringent service contract requirements, and longer sales cycles that can require substantial investments without producing any sales.

Overall, this information may be seen as negative to potential investors as it suggests potential limitations to the company's growth prospects and significant risks associated with their business strategy.</body></html>
