The statement indicates that the company has chosen not to work with the Chinese communist party and is limiting its access to the Chinese market. While this decision reflects the company's values, it may limit its growth prospects. 

The company also notes that it expects to continue to enter into joint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, and strategic alliances, which may present significant risks and challenges. The success of these arrangements is uncertain and dependent on a variety of factors, including the actions of the partners.

Furthermore, the company states that sales to large enterprises and government entities involve risks and uncertainties that may not be present for smaller entities. The sales cycle with these customers can be lengthy, requiring pilot deployments at a low or no cost, and may not necessarily result in a larger contract. Additionally, competition from larger competitors in the market could hinder the success of the company's sales strategy. 

Overall, while the company is making efforts to expand, there are significant challenges and limitations that may adversely impact its business, results of operations, and financial condition.</body></html>
