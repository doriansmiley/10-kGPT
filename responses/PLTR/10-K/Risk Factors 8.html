Summary: The information disclosed in this section of the SEC filing may be negative for a potential investor. There are several risks associated with the company's growth strategy, including challenges in penetrating new markets and attracting and retaining new customers, especially those with limited resources for adopting new technologies. The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and related challenging macroeconomic conditions may adversely impact the company's business and operations, disrupting its customers' operations, causing delayed purchasing decisions, delayed payments, or canceled projects, among other risks. If the market for the company's platforms and services develops more slowly than expected, its growth may slow or stall, and its business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed. The company may also face risks associated with the growth of its business in new commercial markets and with new customer verticals, and it may neither be able to continue its organic growth nor have the necessary resources to dedicate to the overall growth of its business.</body></html>
