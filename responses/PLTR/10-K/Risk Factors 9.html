Summary: The company plans to expand its operations in new commercial markets, including those where it may have limited operating experience, which could lead to increased business, technology, and economic risks that could affect its financial results. While historically sales to new customers have led to additional sales to the same customers or similarly situated customers, expanding into and within new and heavily regulated industry verticals may result in additional regulatory scrutiny, risks, and burdens. Additionally, the company may not be able to secure the financing necessary to operate and grow its business as planned or make acquisitions. The company's debt agreements contain restrictions that may limit its flexibility in operating the business. A default under its credit facility could result in a termination of commitments and foreclosure on assets. Finally, the company faces risks associated with its investments, including the loss of invested capital, if it is unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions or investments.</body></html>
