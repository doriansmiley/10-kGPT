Analysis:
- The company plans to expand into new commercial markets, including those where it may have limited operating experience, which exposes it to increased business, technology, and economic risks that could affect the company's financial results.
- Although historically, sales to new customers have often led to additional sales to the same customers or similarly situated customers, there is no guarantee this trend will continue in the future.
- The company may seek to raise or borrow additional funds to expand its product or business development efforts, make acquisitions or otherwise fund or grow its business and operations. The availability of additional equity or debt financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.
- The company's debt agreements contain significant operating and financial restrictions that could limit its ability to plan for or react to market conditions, restrict corporate activities or result in a default under the credit facility or agreements governing any future indebtedness. The inability to comply with these covenants could result in foreclosure on the company's assets and force the company into bankruptcy or liquidation.
- The company's investment in, acquisition of, or investment in other companies and technologies may divert its management's attention and result in additional dilution to its stockholders. The company may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions or investments.</body></html>
