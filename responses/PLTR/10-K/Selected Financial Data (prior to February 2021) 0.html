Explanation: 
Section 6 of Form 10-Q and Form 10-K is typically reserved for exhibits that provide information required by SEC rules or that provide information not otherwise required, but that is material to an understanding of the financial statements. As this section is not applicable to the evaluation of a company's financial performance, the rating is neutral and there is no score assigned.</body></html>
