Explanation: 

This information is neutral to a potential investor as it does not provide any positive or negative insights into the company's performance. The absence of unresolved staff comments is a routine disclosure in the SEC filings and is not indicative of the company's financial health or growth potential. Therefore, the score for this information is average as it is expected of any company filing its 10-Q or 10-K reports.</body></html>
