Opinion on the Financial Statements  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Palantir Technologies Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, redeemable convertible and convertible preferred stock and stockholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  Basis for Opinion  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  Critical Audit Matter  The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.  ##TABLE_START Revenue Recognition Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generates its revenue primarily from the sale of subscriptions to access its software in the Company&#8217;s hosted environment, along with ongoing operations and maintenance (&#8220;O&#38;M&#8221;) services (&#8220;Palantir Cloud&#8221;); software licenses, primarily term licenses in the customers&#8217; environments, with ongoing O&#38;M services (&#8220;On-Premises Software&#8221;); and professional services. Management applies significant judgment in identifying and evaluating any non-standard terms and conditions in customer arrangements which may impact the determination of performance obligations or the timing of revenue recognition. In addition, the determining whether promises are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately &#8211; or not distinct within the context of the contract and, thus, accounted for together &#8211; requires significant judgment. The Company concluded that the promise to provide a software license is highly interdependent and interrelated with the promise to provide O&#38;M services and such promises are not distinct within the context of its contracts and are accounted for as a single performance obligation for the Company&#8217;s On-Premises Software.  Auditing revenue recognition was complex and required a significant level of auditor judgment to identify and evaluate non-standard terms and conditions that impact revenue recognition and to assess whether the software licenses and O&#38;M services should be accounted for as distinct performance obligations or combined as a single performance obligation.  How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s controls to identify and evaluate terms and conditions and performance obligations in customer arrangements that would impact revenue recognition.  Our substantive procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of management&#8217;s identification and evaluation of non-standard terms and conditions, reading executed contracts for a sample of revenue transactions and evaluating whether the Company appropriately applied its revenue recognition policy to the arrangements based on the terms and conditions therein and consistent with U.S. GAAP. In addition, we evaluated management&#8217;s key assumptions and analysis of its performance obligations, including their assessment of the nature, interdependency, and level of integration between the software license and O&#38;M services. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  ##TABLE_END /s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP  We have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2008.  San Jose, California  February 21, 2023  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Palantir Technologies Inc.  Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  We have audited Palantir Technologies Inc.&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
