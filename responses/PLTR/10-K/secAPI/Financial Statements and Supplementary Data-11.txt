Business Combinations  On November 8, 2022, the Company gained the right to majority representation on the board of directors of Palantir Japan, thereby obtaining a controlling interest. Prior to obtaining a controlling interest, the Company accounted for its 50 % ownership in Palantir Japan as an equity method investment, which was created to distribute Palantir platforms to the Japanese market. This transaction was accounted for as a &#8220;step acquisition&#8221; (as defined by U.S. GAAP), as such, the Company remeasured its pre-existing equity interest in Palantir Japan immediately prior to the completion of the acquisition to its estimated fair value. The results of Palantir Japan have been included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date, with the portion outside of its control forming a noncontrolling interest.  The fair value of Palantir Japan on the acquisition date totaled $ 149.0 million, which included the Company&#8217;s equity interest immediately prior to the acquisition of $ 74.5 million and the noncontrolling interest of $ 74.5 million. The amounts recognized  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date included: cash of $ 66.7 million; goodwill of $ 36.1 million; intangible assets of $ 34.7 million related to customer relationships, reacquired rights, and backlog; $ 32.5 million of other identifiable assets; and $ 21.0 million of net liabilities. The intangible assets are reported in other assets and are being amortized over a period of two to seven years in accordance with the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by the future net cash flows. Goodwill is reported in other assets and is primarily attributed to the value expected from synergies resulting from the Palantir Japan acquisition. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.  The acquisition-date fair value of the noncontrolling and controlling equity interest was determined using a combination of the income and market approaches. With respect to intangible assets, the estimated fair values were determined based on the excess earnings method of the income approach. These models used primarily Level 3 inputs, including estimates of projected revenue growth rates, projected EBITDA margins, and an estimated discount rate.  In accordance with accounting for a step acquisition, the Company recognized a gain of $ 44.3 million as a result of remeasuring its pre-existing interest in Palantir Japan held immediately before the business combination, which is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  The amounts of Palantir Japan&#8217;s revenue and net income included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 were immaterial. This acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s reported revenue or net loss amounts for any period presented; therefore, historical and pro forma disclosures have not been presented.  15.
