Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  1. Organization  Palantir Technologies Inc. (including its subsidiaries, &#8220;Palantir&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in Delaware on May 6, 2003. The Company builds and deploys software platforms that serve as the central operating systems for its customers.  2. Significant Accounting Policies  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding annual financial reporting. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Palantir Technologies Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company holds at least a 20% ownership interest and has the ability to exercise significant influence over, but does not control, the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For such investments, the share of the investee&#8217;s results of operations is included as a component of other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and the investment balance is included in other assets and classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, loss from operations, net loss, or cash flows. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year ends on December 31.  Direct Listing  On September 30, 2020, the Company completed a direct listing of its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) (the &#8220;Direct Listing&#8221;). Immediately prior to the Direct Listing, all outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible preferred stock were converted into Class B common stock, and all of the Company&#8217;s outstanding preferred stock warrants were converted into common stock warrants, which resulted in the reclassification of the warrants liability to additional paid-in capital.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  Significant estimates and assumptions made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the identification of performance obligations in customer contracts; the valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions; the collectability of contract consideration, including accounts receivable; the useful lives of tangible assets; the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from business combinations, including intangible assets and goodwill; and the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could affect the Company&#8217;s financial position and results of operations.  Segments  The Company has two operating segments, commercial and government, which were determined based on the manner in which the chief operating decision maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;), who is the chief executive officer, manages the operations of the Company for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance. Various factors, including the Company&#8217;s organizational and management reporting structure and customer type, were considered in determining these operating segments.  The Company&#8217;s operating segments are described below:  &#8226; Commercial: This segment primarily serves customers working in non-government industries.  &#8226; Government: This segment primarily serves customers that are United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) government and non-U.S. government agencies.  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents primarily consist of amounts invested in money market funds.  Restricted cash primarily consists of cash and certificates of deposit that are held as collateral against letters of credit and guarantees that the Company is required to maintain for operating lease agreements, certain customer contracts, and other guarantees and financing arrangements.
