Cost of Revenue  Cost of revenue primarily includes salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing O&#38;M and professional services, as well as third-party cloud hosting services, travel costs, allocated overhead, and other direct costs.  Sales and Marketing Costs  Sales and marketing costs primarily include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in sales functions, executing on pilots, and performing other brand building activities, as well as third-party cloud hosting services for our pilots, marketing and sales event-related costs, travel costs, and allocated overhead. The Company generally charges all such costs to sales and marketing expense in the period incurred. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in sales and marketing expense within the consolidated statements of operations. Advertising expense totaled $ 38.6 million and $ 26.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2020.  Research and Development Costs  Research and development costs primarily include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing the activities to develop and improve the Company&#8217;s platforms and products, as well as third-party cloud hosting services, travel costs, and allocated overhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  Commitments and Contingencies  Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, disputes, legal proceedings, fines and penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. Recoveries of such legal costs from insurance policies are recorded as an offset to legal expenses in the period they are received.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of GAAP, which require compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. The Company determines the fair value of stock-based awards granted or modified on the grant date or modification date using appropriate valuation techniques.  Service-Based Vesting  The Company grants RSUs and stock option awards that vest only based upon the satisfaction of a service condition. For RSUs, the Company determines the grant-date fair value of the RSUs as the fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the grant date. The Company records stock-based compensation expense for stock options and RSUs that vest only based upon the  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  satisfaction of a service condition on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years . For stock option awards, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock options granted. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of the common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of the common stock. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the option awards represent management&#8217;s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management&#8217;s judgment. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.  Performance-Based Vesting  The Company grants awards, including RSUs, that vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a performance condition. The performance-based vesting condition for the RSUs granted prior to the Company&#8217;s Direct Listing was satisfied upon the occurrence of the Direct Listing and are expensed using the accelerated attribution method over the remaining service period.  Employee Benefit Plan  The Company sponsors a 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan for all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Participants may contribute, on a pretax and post-tax basis, a percentage of their qualifying annual compensation, but not to exceed a maximum contribution amount pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company may make additional matching contributions on behalf of the participants. The Company did not make matching contributions for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.  Income Taxes  The Company estimates its current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets, which are estimated based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized. Accordingly, the realization of the Company&#8217;s deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions, losses, and credits can be utilized.  The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and recognizes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a future benefit on such deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance, when recorded, would be included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of operations. Management&#8217;s judgment is required in determining the Company&#8217;s valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets.  The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company is subject to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;) tax in the U.S. and has elected to treat taxes on future GILTI inclusions as current period expense if and when incurred.  Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders  The Company computes net loss per share attributable to its common stockholders using the two-class method required for participating securities, which determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in distributed and undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed.  The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Class A, Class B, and Class F common stock (collectively, the &#8220;common stock&#8221;) are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis and the resulting net loss per share will, therefore, be the same for all classes of common stock on an individual or comb ined basis. As such, the Company has presented the net loss attributed to its common stock on a combined basis.  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  Noncontrolling Interests  A noncontrolling interest represents the proportionate equity interest in a subsidiary that is not attributable, either directly or indirectly, to the Company and is reported as equity of the Company, separate from the Company&#8217;s controlling interest. Revenues, expenses, gains, losses, net income (loss), and other comprehensive income (loss) are reported in the consolidated financial statements at the consolidated amounts, which include the amounts attributable to both the controlling and noncontrolling interest.  Foreign Currency  Generally, the functional currency of the Company&#8217;s international subsidiaries is the local currency of the country in which they operate. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment and included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  For transactions that are not denominated in the local functional currency, the Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Transaction gains and losses from the remeasurement are recognized in other income (expense), net within the consolidated statements of operations.
