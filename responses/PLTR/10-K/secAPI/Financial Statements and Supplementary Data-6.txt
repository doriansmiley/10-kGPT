3. Contract Liabilities and Remaining Performance Obligations  Contract Liabilities  The Company&#8217;s contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and customer deposits. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company&#8217;s contract liability balances were $ 339.2 million and $ 463.3 million, respectively. Revenue of $ 384.3 million and $ 378.4 million was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, that was included in the contract liabilities balances as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  Remaining Performance Obligations  The Company&#8217;s arrangements with its customers often have terms that span over multiple years. However, the Company allows many of its customers to terminate contracts for convenience prior to the end of the stated term with less than twelve months&#8217; notice. Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents noncancelable contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and, in certain instances, amounts that will be invoiced. The Company has elected the practical expedient allowing the Company to not disclose remaining performance obligations for contracts with original terms of twelve months or less. Cancelable contracted revenue, which includes customer deposits, is not considered a remaining performance obligation.  The Company&#8217;s remaining performance obligations were $ 972.7 million as of December 31, 2022, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 53 % as revenue over the next 12 months, 38 % as revenue over the subsequent 13 to 36 months, and the remainder thereafter.
