, Case No. 23-cv-118, and on January 27, 2023, a stockholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Miao v. Karp, et al. , Case No. 1:23-cv-00103-MN, each against certain current and former officers and directors asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to the allegations of the securities class action complaints and seek unspecified damages and injunctive remedies under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Delaware law. Because the litigation is in early stages, the Company is unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters.  As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company was not aware of any currently pending legal matters or claims, individually or in the aggregate, that are expected to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial statements.  Letters of Credit and Guarantees  The Company had irrevocable standby letters of credit and guarantees, including bank guarantees, outstanding in the amounts of $ 28.8 million and $ 76.2 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which were fully collateralized. The Company is required to maintain these letters of credit and guarantees primarily in connection with operating lease agreements, certain customer contracts, and other guarantees and financing arrangements. As of December 31, 2022, these letters of credit and guarantees had expiration dates through August 2031.  Warranties and Indemnification  The Company generally provides a warranty for its software products and services and a service level agreement (&#8220;SLA&#8221;) for the Company&#8217;s performance of software operations via its O&#38;M services to its customers. The Company&#8217;s products are generally warranted to perform substantially as described in the associated product documentation during the subscription term or for a period of up to 90 days where the software is hosted by the customer, and the Company includes O&#38;M services as part of its subscription and license agreements to support this warranty and maintain the operability of the software. The Company&#8217;s services are generally warranted to be performed in a professional manner and by an adequate staff with knowledge about the products. In the event there is a failure of such warranties, the Company generally is obligated to correct the product or service to conform to the warranty provision, as set forth in the applicable SLA, or, if the Company is unable to do so, the customer is entitled to seek a refund of the purchase price of the product and service (generally prorated over the contract term). Due to the absence of historical warranty claims, the Company&#8217;s expectations of future claims related to products under warranty continue to be insignificant. The Company has not recorded warranty expense or related accruals as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.  The Company generally agrees to indemnify its customers against legal claims that the Company&#8217;s software products infringe certain third-party intellectual property rights and accounts for its indemnification obligations. In the event of such a claim, the Company is generally obligated to defend its customer against the claim and to either settle the claim at the Company&#8217;s expense  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  or pay damages that the customer is legally required to pay to the third-party claimant. In addition, in the event of an infringement, the Company generally agrees to secure the right for the customer to continue using the infringing product; to modify or replace the infringing product; or, if those options are not commercially practicable, to refund the cost of the software, as prorated over the period. To date, the Company has not been required to make any payment resulting from infringement claims asserted against its customers and does not believe that the Company will be liable for such claims in the foreseeable future. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for infringement costs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.  The Company has obligations under certain circumstances to indemnify each of the defendant directors and certain officers against judgments, fines, settlements, and expenses related to claims against such directors and certain officers and otherwise to the fullest extent permitted under the law and the Company&#8217;s bylaws and Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.  9. Stockholders&#8217; Equity  The Company&#8217;s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of a total of 20,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 2,700,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, and 1,005,000 shares of Class F common stock. In September 2020, each of the Founders exchanged 335,000 shares of their Class B common stock for an equivalent number of shares of Class F common stock.  The Company&#8217;s Class A, Class B, and Class F common stock (collectively, the &#8220;common stock&#8221;) all have the same rights, except with respect to voting and conversion rights. Class A and Class B common stock have voting rights of 1 and 10 votes per share, respectively. The Class F common stock has the voting rights generally described herein and each share of Class F common stock is convertible at any time, at the option of the holder thereof, into one share of Class B common stock. All shares of Class F common stock are held in a voting trust established by Stephen Cohen, Alexander Karp, and Peter Thiel (the &#8220;Founders&#8221;). The Class F common stock generally gives the Founders the ability to control up to 49.999999 % of the total voting power of the Company&#8217;s capital stock, so long as the Founders and certain of their affiliates collectively meet a minimum ownership threshold, which was 100.0 million of the Company's equity securities as of December 31, 2022.  Holders of the common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if declared by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. No dividends have been declared as of December 31, 2022.  The following represented the total authorized, issued, and outstanding shares for each class of common stock (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2022 As of December 31, 2021 Authorized Issued and Outstanding Authorized Issued and Outstanding Class A Common Stock 20,000,000 &#160; 1,995,414 &#160; 20,000,000 &#160; 1,926,589 &#160; Class B Common Stock 2,700,000 &#160; 102,656 &#160; 2,700,000 &#160; 99,880 &#160; Class F Common Stock 1,005 &#160; 1,005 &#160; 1,005 &#160; 1,005 &#160; Total 22,701,005 &#160; 2,099,075 &#160; 22,701,005 &#160; 2,027,474 &#160; ##TABLE_END 10. Stock-Based Compensation  2020 Executive Equity Incentive Plan  In August 2020, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved the 2020 Executive Equity Incentive Plan (the &#8220;Executive Equity Plan&#8221;). The Executive Equity Plan permitted the granting of nonstatutory stock options (&#8220;NSOs&#8221;) and RSUs to the Company&#8217;s employees, consultants, and directors. A total of 165,900,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Class B common stock were reserved for issuance under the Executive Equity Plan. During August 2020, options to purchase 162,000,000 shares of Class B common stock and restricted stock units covering 3,900,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Class B common stock were granted to certain officers.  The Executive Equity Plan was terminated prior to the Company&#8217;s Direct Listing, and no additional awards will be granted under the Executive Equity Plan. However, the Executive Equity Plan will continue to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards previously granted under the Executive Equity Plan.  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  2020 Equity Incentive Plan  In September 2020, prior to the Direct Listing, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (&#8220;2020 Plan&#8221;). The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options (&#8220;ISOs&#8221;), NSOs, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights (&#8220;SARs&#8221;), and performance awards to the Company&#8217;s employees, directors, and consultants. A total of 150,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance pursuant to the 2020 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan includes certain shares of common stock subject to awards under the 2010 Plan and Executive Equity Plan in the case of certain occurrences, such as expirations, terminations, exercise and tax-related withholding, or failures to vest. Shares of Class B common stock added to the 2020 Plan from the 2010 Plan or Executive Equity Plan are reserved for issuance under the Company&#8217;s 2020 Plan as Class A common stock. The number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the 2020 Plan will also include an annual increase on the first day of each fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2022, equal to the least of:  &#8226; 250,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock;  &#8226; Five percent of the outstanding shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year; or  &#8226; such other amount as the administrator of the 2020 Plan determines.  Under the 2020 Plan, the exercise price of options granted is generally at least equal to the fair market value of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock on the date of grant. The term of an ISO generally may not exceed ten years . Additionally, the exercise price of any ISO granted to a 10 % stockholder shall not be less than 110 % of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and the term of such option grant shall not exceed five years . Options and other equity awards become vested and, if applicable, exercisable based on terms determined by the Board of Directors or another plan administrator on the date of grant, which is typically four years for new employees and varies for subsequent grants.
