Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes  Provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business and withholding taxes.  Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests  Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our joint venture partners&#8217; proportionate share of the results of operations of the respective joint venture.  Segments  We have two operating segments, commercial and government, which were determined based on the manner in which the chief operating decision maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;), who is our chief executive officer, manages our operations for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance. Various factors, including our organizational and management reporting structure and customer type, were considered in determining these operating segments.  Our operating segments are described below:  &#8226; Commercial: This segment primarily serves customers working in non-government industries.  &#8226; Government: This segment primarily serves customers that are U.S. government and non-U.S. government agencies.  Segment profitability is evaluated based on contribution and contribution margin. Contribution is segment revenue less the related costs of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense. Contribution margin is contribution divided by revenue. To the extent costs of revenue or sales and marketing expenses are not directly attributable to a particular segment, they are allocated based upon headcount at each operating segment during the period. We use it, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, each of our operating segments, which excludes certain operating expenses that are not allocated to operating segments because they are separately managed at the consolidated corporate level. These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation expense, research and development costs, and general and administrative costs, such as legal and accounting.

The following table sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue:  ##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Revenue 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost of revenue 21 22 32 Gross profit 79 78 68 Operating expenses: Sales and marketing 37 40 63 Research and development 19 25 51 General and administrative 31 40 61 Total operating expenses 87 105 175 Loss from operations (8) (27) (107) Interest income 1 &#8212; &#8212; Interest expense &#8212; &#8212; (1) Other income (expense), net (12) (5) &#8212; Loss before provision for (benefit from) income taxes (19) (32) (108) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 1 2 (1) Net loss (20) (34) (107) Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Net loss attributable to common stockholders (20) % (34) % (107) % ##TABLE_END Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021  Revenue  ##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount % Revenue: Government $ 1,071,776 $ 897,356 $ 174,420 19 % Commercial 834,095 644,533 189,562 29 % Total revenue $ 1,905,871 $ 1,541,889 $ 363,982 24 % ##TABLE_END Revenue increased by $364.0 million, or 24%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. Revenue from government customers increased by $174.4 million, or 19%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, primarily from customers in the United States. Revenue growth slowed compared to the prior year as a result of increased delays in the completion of the U.S. government budgeting process when compared to their budgeting process in the prior year. Of the increase, $151.1 million was from government customers existing as of December 31, 2021. Generally, increases in revenue from our existing customers are a result of expanded use of our products and services within their organizations. Revenue from U.S. government customers was $826.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $678.2 million for the same period in 2021. Revenue from commercial customers increased by $189.6 million, or 29%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. Of the increase, $96.8 million was from new customers as of December 31, 2021, of which $27.0 million was revenue from customers with which we had entered into concurrent Investment Agreements. See Note 4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.  Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit  ##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount % Cost of revenue $ 408,549 $ 339,404 $ 69,145 20 % Gross profit 1,497,322 1,202,485 294,837 25 % Gross margin 79 % 78 % ##TABLE_END Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $69.1 million, or 20%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of $33.0 million in third-party cloud hosting services driven by increased usage from customer growth and expansion, $29.4 million in field service representatives mainly related to new projects, $18.1 million in payroll and other payroll-related costs as a result of increased headcount attributable to our cost of revenue function, and $11.9 million in travel and office-related costs. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of $31.0 million in stock-based compensation expense and related expenses. For additional information, see the section titled &#8220;Stock-Based Compensation&#8221; below.  Our gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by 1% compared to 2021. Gross margin increased as a result of revenue growth outpacing costs of revenue. The primary cause of this growth rate variation was the decrease in stock-based compensation expense and related expenses in cost of revenue relative to total expense growth as compared to the prior year.  Operating Expenses  ##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount % Sales and marketing $ 702,511 $ 614,512 $ 87,999 14 % Research and development 359,679 387,487 (27,808) (7) % General and administrative 596,333 611,532 (15,199) (2) % Total operating expenses $ 1,658,523 $ 1,613,531 $ 44,992 3 % ##TABLE_END Sales and Marketing  Sales and marketing expenses increased by $88.0 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of $93.1 million in payroll and other payroll-related costs driven by increased headcount attributable to our sales and marketing function, $36.3 million in travel and office-related costs, and $23.5 million in marketing and advertising expenses. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of $81.3 million in stock-based compensation expense and related expenses. For additional information, see the section titled &#8220;Stock-Based Compensation&#8221; below.  Research and Development  Research and development expenses decreased by $27.8 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $75.1 million in stock-based compensation expense and related expenses. For additional information, see the section titled &#8220;Stock-Based Compensation&#8221; below. The decrease was partially offset by increases of $22.8 million in payroll and other payroll-related costs driven by increased headcount attributable to our research and development function, $12.0 million in travel and office-related costs, and $11.6 million in third-party cloud hosting services and other IT costs driven by increased usage to support customer growth and expansion, as well as other IT costs to support company growth.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses decreased by $15.2 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $113.0 million in stock-based compensation expense and related expenses. For additional information see the section titled &#8220;Stock-Based Compensation&#8221; below. This decrease was partially offset by increases of $34.1 million in travel and office-related costs, $28.9 million in payroll and other payroll-related costs driven by increased headcount attributable to our general and administrative functions, $15.0 million in professional service fees mainly related to legal and financial services, and a $10.1 million allowance for credit losses.
