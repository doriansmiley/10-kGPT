The decrease was primarily driven by forfeitures and lower expense under the accelerated attribution method for RSUs granted prior to September 30, 2020, the date of our Direct Listing, during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, partially offset by an increase related to awards granted after December 31, 2021.

For additional information see Note 4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements and Note 14. Business Combinations in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Company maintains a full valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state and U.K. deferred tax assets. For additional information see Note 11. Income Taxes in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We generated positive cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 and had $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents available as of December 31, 2022. We believe that cash flows generated from operations, cash, cash equivalents, available funds and access to financing sources, including our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. We have generated significant losses from our operations as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and we expect cash flow from operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future. Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of our equity securities, including proceeds from option exercises, and payments received from our customers.  As of December 31, 2022, our accumulated deficit balance was $5.9 billion, and our principal sources of liquidity were $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents.  During April 2021, we repaid our outstanding term loans of $200.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding debt balances and additional available and undrawn revolving and DDTL commitments of $950.0 million under our credit agreement to fund working capital and general corporate expenditures. No amounts were drawn as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information, see Note 6. Debt in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to the rate of our growth, our ability to attract and retain customers and their willingness and ability to pay for our products and services, and the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to market and develop our products. Further, we may enter into future arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services, strategic partnerships, and technologies. As such, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If additional funds are not available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.  The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 223,737 $ 333,851 $ (296,608) Investing activities (45,427) (397,912) (14,920) Financing activities 85,996 306,747 1,036,453 Effect of foreign exchange on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash  (3,885) (3,918) 1,259 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash  $ 260,421 $ 238,768 $ 726,184 ##TABLE_END Operating Activities  Net cash provided by operating activities was $223.7 million and $333.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by timing of payments to vendors and timing of the receipt of payments from our customers.  Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities was $45.4 million and $397.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a reduction of our purchases of alternative investments and marketable securities, as well as increases from cash acquired from business combinations and sales or redemption of certain marketable securities.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities was $86.0 million and $306.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was driven by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by the principal repayments on borrowings of $200.0 million made during the year ended December 31, 2021.  Contractual Obligations and Commitments  The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Noncancelable purchase commitments (1)  $ 1,275,377 $ 169,124 $ 591,000 $ 515,253 $ &#8212; Operating lease commitments, net of sublease income amounts (2)  193,075 40,385 74,633 38,550 39,507 Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 1,468,452 $ 209,509 $ 665,633 $ 553,803 $ 39,507 ##TABLE_END &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;  (1) Noncancelable purchase commitments primarily relate to purchase commitments for third-party cloud hosting services and represents only contracts which are enforceable and legally binding.

Commitments and Contingencies in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.  (2) The contractual commitment amounts under operating leases in the table above are primarily related to facility and equipment leases. Operating lease commitments are reflected net of $120.8 million of sublease income from tenants in certain of our leased facilities. Refer to Note 7. Leases in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.  The contractual obligations and commitments in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding.  Contract Liabilities  Our contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and customer deposits.  Deferred revenue represents billings under noncancelable contracts before the related product or service is transferred to the customer. The portion of deferred revenue that is anticipated to be recognized as revenue during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred revenue, noncurrent.  Customer deposits consist of amounts billed and/or paid for anticipated revenue generating activities in advance of the start of the contractual term or for the portion of a contract term that is subject to cancellation by our customers. The portion of customer deposits that is anticipated to be recognized as revenue during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as customer deposits and the remaining portion is recorded as customer deposits, noncurrent.  Our deferred revenue and deferred revenue, noncurrent as of December 31, 2022 were $183.4 million and $10.0 million, respectively. Our customer deposits and customer deposits, noncurrent as of December 31, 2022 were $142.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively.
