 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in the value of our investments, interest rates, foreign exchange, and inflation.  Market Risk  As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding investments in marketable securities valued at $35.1 million. We have sold, and may continue to sell, some or all of our existing investments. These Investments are often in early- or growth-stage companies that have minimal public trading history; as such the fair value of these Investments may fluctuate depending on the financial outcome and prospects of the Investees, as well as global market conditions including recent and ongoing volatility related to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and rising interest rates. Additionally, investing in early- or growth-stage companies carries inherent risks because, among other things, the technologies or products that are being developed by these companies are typically in the early phases and may never materialize or they may not achieve their growth or other business objectives, and they have and may continue to experience a decline in financial condition, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our investment in these companies. We record gains or losses as the fair value of these Investments change and as we sell them. We anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market prices and declines in financial conditions of Investees, and as such gains and losses are realized. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, net unrealized losses of $159.0 million and net realized losses of $113.1 million related to marketable securities were recorded in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. We do not currently anticipate entering into new Investment Agreements to purchase, or commit to purchase, securities of special purpose acquisition companies.  Interest Rate Risk  Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash consist of cash, certificates of deposit, and money market funds. Our primary investment policy and strategies are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements; however, to a lesser extent we have made and may continue to make investments in early- and growth-stage companies as disclosed in Note 4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not currently anticipate entering into new Investment Agreements to purchase, or commit to purchase, securities of special purpose acquisition companies.  Due to the short-term nature of the financial instruments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates.  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk  Our contracts with customers are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, with the remaining denominated in foreign currencies. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in the United States, United Kingdom, and other European countries. Our results of current and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro and GBP. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations in net loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring certain assets and liability balances that are denominated in foreign currencies. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material to our consolidated financial statements, and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions.  Inflation Risk  We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
