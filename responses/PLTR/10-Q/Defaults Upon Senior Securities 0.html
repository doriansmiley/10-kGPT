Score: Average

Explanation: The fact that there are no defaults upon senior securities is a good sign for a potential investor as it indicates that the company is not struggling financially and is able to make timely payments on its debt obligations. However, this is a fairly standard piece of information and does not necessarily indicate exceptional performance for a high growth company. Therefore, the score is based on the performance of an average high growth company.</body></html>
