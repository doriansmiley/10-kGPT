The information provided is negative to a potential investor with an average score. The balance sheet, revenue, and cash flow statements are unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and do not include all disclosures required by GAAP. Although management believes that these unaudited statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the financial position and results of operations, they are not necessarily indicative of the full fiscal year or any future period. The quality of the balance sheet and revenue is impaired due to the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The presence of Concentrations of Credit Risk also adds to the impairment of the balance sheet. The information also shows that revenue of $192.4 million and $187.0 million was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively, that was included in the contract liability balances as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, thereby further casting a doubt on the performance of the company in the short-term future.</body></html>
