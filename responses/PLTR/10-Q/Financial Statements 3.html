The information provided in the filing appears to be positive for a potential investor. The company has no outstanding debt balances and had an aggregate of $950.0 million undrawn of revolving and DDTL commitments under the 2014 Credit Facility as of March 31, 2023. Further, the company was in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2014 Credit Facility as of the same date.

As of March 31, 2023, the company has only satisfied $82.3 million of its $199.0 million commitment for contract year, ending September 30, 2023. Therefore, the company has an obligation to make a return payment if the spend does not meet the minimum annual commitment amount. 

Moreover, the filing mentions pending litigation against the company, including putative securities class action complaints and stockholder derivative actions. However, the company was not aware of any currently pending legal matters or claims that were expected to have a material adverse impact on its financial statements, as of March 31, 2023.
