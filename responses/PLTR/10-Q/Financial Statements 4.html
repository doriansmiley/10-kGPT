 RSU activity appears neutral as there is a decrease in RSUs outstanding but an increase in the total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense. The stock-based compensation expense has decreased over the year, which is positive news, but still remains relatively high. Income taxes decreased from benefit to provision this year, and the company maintained its valuation allowance on its U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets which can indicate potential risks. The new regulations from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 are not expected to materially impact the company. The net loss per share has stayed consistent but does not provide much insight into improving financials. The revenue by geography shows positive growth in the Rest of the world segment. Looking at the financials and considering Palantir's future growth prospects, the company's performance seems neutral to a potential investor.
