Explanation: 

Based on the above excerpt, the company appears to have legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. However, the company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible losses will not have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition. While the outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the company is confident that a possible unfavorable resolution will not materially affect its future business, results of operations, or financial condition. Hence, investors can perceive this information as positive. However, the diversion of management resources and other factors associated with such litigation can have an adverse impact on the company. The score is considered average as most companies have legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.</body></html>
