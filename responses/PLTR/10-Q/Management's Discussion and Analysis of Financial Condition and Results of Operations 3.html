However, the data regarding the company's cost of revenue and gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2022, may suggest a decrease in efficiency and profitability as the costs to support new deployments and company growth, including field service representatives and payroll costs, have grown at a higher rate than revenue. Moreover, sales and marketing expenses have increased by $29.5 million, or 19%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and $60.4 million, or 13%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the same periods in 2021. Research and development expenses have also increased, and general and administrative expenses have decreased slightly for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and have decreased by $7.6 million, or 2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. 

Overall, the data presents positive revenue growth, and although there have been some increases in expenses, the company's overall performance can be deemed average.</body></html>
