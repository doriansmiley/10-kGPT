- Stock-based compensation expenses decreased by 24% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and by 29% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods last year.
- Interest income increased by $5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and by $6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods last year.
- Interest expense increased by $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to amortization of upfront debt issuance costs, and decreased by $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the full repayment of the outstanding debt balance during the second quarter of 2021.
- Other income (expense), net changed by $56.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and by $249.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to unrealized and realized losses, net from investments in marketable securities.
- Provision for income taxes decreased by $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and increased by $6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods last year, primarily due to the absence in the current period of the revaluation of our U.K. deferred tax assets as a result of a change in the U.K. corporate tax rate enacted in June 2021.

- Net cash provided by operating activities was $145.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, with a decrease from last year primarily driven by timing of the receipt of payments from our customers and timing of payments to vendors.
- Net cash used in investing activities was $118.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, with a decrease from last year primarily a result of reducing purchases of alternative investments and marketable securities and selling or redeeming certain marketable securities.
- Net cash provided by financing activities was $71.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, which primarily consisted of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options.
- Contractual obligations and commitments primarily consist of operating lease commitments for facilities and non-cancelable purchase commitments related to third-party cloud hosting services.
