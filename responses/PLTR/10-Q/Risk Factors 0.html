The risk factors section in the filing highlights numerous risks and uncertainties that are associated with investing in the company. The company has experienced losses since inception and may not become profitable in the future. Also, sustaining the revenue growth rate may be challenging, and sales efforts involve considerable time and expense with unpredictable sales cycles. The limited number of customers accounts for a substantial portion of revenue, and results of operations and key business measures may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. The platforms are complex, and there may be a lengthy implementation process, which may impact the successful deployment of new technologies. Additionally, the company may not be able to maintain and enhance its brand and reputation, and unfavorable social media coverage may harm its reputation and business. The intense competition in its markets, unfavorable outcomes in legal, regulatory, and administrative inquiries and proceedings, and subjectivity to complex and evolving regulations regarding privacy, data protection and security, technology protection, and other matters further adds to the risks. All of these factors combined lead to a negative rating for a potential investor with a score below average.</body></html>
