Summary: The Risk Factor section of the filing highlights numerous risks associated with investing in the company's Class A common stock. The company has a history of losses and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future. The revenue growth rate has declined in recent periods, and sales efforts involve considerable time and expense, with a long and unpredictable sales cycle. The Company's platforms are complex, have a lengthy implementation process, and must operate with third-party products and services. The company may be unable to successfully develop and deploy new technologies to address customer needs. The company faces intense competition in the markets it operates in, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical events continue to pose significant risks to its operations. Overall, the risks described in the filing suggest a below-average score for an average high-growth company, which may not appeal to potential investors seeking a stable and predictable return on their investment.</body></html>
