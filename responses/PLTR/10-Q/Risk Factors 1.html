Summary:
- The company heavily relies on sales to enterprise customers, which are influenced by various external factors.
- The company has a limited number of customers accounting for a substantial portion of revenue, leaving them vulnerable to revenue decline if these customers do not renew contracts or make subsequent purchases.
- The company's ability to renew and expand customer relationships may decrease due to factors such as customer satisfaction, economic conditions, and competitive offerings.
- The company historically has not realized all revenue from the full deal value of customer contracts, and this may continue in the future due to various contingencies.
- The company's results of operations and key business measures are likely to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, making it difficult to predict and causing negative impacts on the value of their Class A common stock.
- The company's sales cycle is often long, and delays or losses in large sales transactions can impact future revenue and cash flow.</body></html>
