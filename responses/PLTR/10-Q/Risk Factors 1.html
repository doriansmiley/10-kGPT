The extracted information highlights several factors that can potentially harm the business operations and financial condition of the company, making it unfavorable for a prospective investor. Firstly, the company heavily relies on sales to enterprise customers which may have uncertain business projections, budget constraints and could perceive other factors while purchasing the company's platforms. Secondly, the company faces challenges in selling its platforms and services to customers due to their vested interests in their own internally developed software solutions. Thirdly, the company generates a significant portion of its revenue from existing customers that expand their relationships with the company. However, if existing customers do not make subsequent purchases or renew their contracts, the company's revenue may decline. Fourthly, the company's ability to renew or expand customer relationships may decrease due to various factors such as economic conditions, software and implementation errors, and competitive offerings or alternatives. Fifthly, the company may not realize the full deal value of its customer contracts, which may result in lower than expected revenue. Lastly, the company's results of operations and financial performance fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, making its future predictions unreliable. Overall, the company faces a plethora of challenges and uncertainties that can have a significant impact on its business and financial condition.</body></html>
