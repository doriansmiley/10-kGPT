The page extracted from the filing reveals several risks that could potentially have a negative impact on the company's financial performance. First, unauthorized copying and distribution of the company's products could adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations. As the company expands its customer base, the likelihood of customers violating its terms of service also increases, which could cause reputational damage.

Second, the company and its third-party vendors are susceptible to cybersecurity attacks and threats. Such attacks or security breaches may damage or disrupt the company's technology systems and compromise its sensitive or confidential information, resulting in significant remediation costs, litigation, disputes, regulatory actions, or investigations. 

Third, AI algorithms may be flawed, and datasets may be insufficient or of poor quality, which could impair the acceptance of AI solutions. Additionally, some AI scenarios may present ethical issues, subjecting the company to new or heightened legal, regulatory, ethical, or other challenges. 

Fourth, the company relies on computing infrastructure operated by AWS, Microsoft, and other third parties to support some of its customers, and any errors, disruption, performance problems, or failure in their or the company's operational infrastructure could adversely affect its financial performance.

Overall, based on the risks outlined in the filing, the company's score is considered low, indicating a significant amount of risks that could negatively impact its financial prospects.</body></html>
