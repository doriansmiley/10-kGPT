The information provided in this page of the filing highlights several risks and challenges that the company faces, which could be a cause for concern for a potential investor. The company warns of the possibility of violation claims and the potential impact on their business and financial condition. There is also a significant risk associated with errors, failures, defects or bugs in their platforms, which could cause delays, damage their reputation, and lead to revenue loss, as their customers require high-quality products. Furthermore, integrating their software with third-party technology creates a dependency that could lead to issues with licensing, or infringement of intellectual property, resulting in product rollbacks and delays in product releases.
