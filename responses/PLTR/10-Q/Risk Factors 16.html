The extracted page from the 10-Q and 10-K filings highlights several risks associated with the company's non-U.S. operations, including compliance with foreign laws and regulations, new sources of competition, unfair or corrupt business practices, volatility in non-U.S. political and economic environments, weaker protection of intellectual property rights, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, management and employee communication and integration problems, difficulties in repatriating funds, adverse tax consequences, lack of familiarity with local laws and customs, potential interruptions to business operations due to events such as war or public health concerns, and governmental action that could interfere with the company's ability to sell its platforms in certain countries. Additionally, the company is subject to governmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, and noncompliance could result in investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, fines, damages, litigation, and other consequences. The company is also involved in various legal, regulatory, and administrative inquiries and proceedings, which can be expensive and time-consuming, and detract attention from the company's primary business operations. These risks and uncertainties may negatively impact the company's financial stability and growth prospects, resulting in a below-average score for investors.</body></html>
