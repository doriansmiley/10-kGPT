The information presented in this section highlights the risks associated with the company's operations and its obligations to comply with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. The company's operations in countries with developing economies posed a heightened risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by its employees or third-party business partners, representatives, and agents in violation of various laws including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The potential penalties, including criminal or civil sanctions, could significantly affect the company's business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects. 

In addition, the company's offerings are subject to U.S. export controls, sanctions, and related regimes, which could limit its ability to compete in certain markets. Compliance with the EAR, ITAR, and other applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of its products may create delays in the introduction of its products in non-U.S. markets, prevent its customers with non-U.S. operations from deploying their products throughout their global systems, or in some cases, prevent the export of its products to some countries altogether. Moreover, any violations of export control and sanctions laws could lead to significant per violation fines or other penalties, and its platforms may be denied entry into other countries. 

Overall, the information presented highlights the significant risks and uncertainties associated with the company's operations and compliance with various laws and regulations, which could adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.</body></html>
