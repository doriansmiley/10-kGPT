The information in the extracted filing suggests a number of potential risks to a prospective investor. These risks include changes in tax policies and regulations, potential limitations on the company's ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, and the risk of facing sales tax or other related tax liabilities in jurisdictions where the company has not historically done so. In addition, the filing notes that a significant portion of the company's business depends on sales to the public sector, and that changes in fiscal or contracting policies, decreases in available government funding, and other factors could adversely affect the company's business prospects. Finally, the filing notes that the company has contracts with governments that involve classified programs, which may limit investor insight into portions of the company's business. Overall, these potential risks suggest that the company's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected, earning a below average score.</body></html>
