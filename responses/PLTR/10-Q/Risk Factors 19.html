The information presented in the SEC filing suggests a higher risk associated with government contracts and regulations. Changes in the government's attitude and policies towards the company's capabilities may lead to delays or reduced purchases from government customers. The company faces multiple challenges in obtaining and maintaining security clearances for their employees, which may directly impact their ability to win new contracts. Additionally, many customer contracts may be terminated by the customer at any time for convenience, with short notice, and may involve additional rights and remedies favorable to the government. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, or contractual provisions may lead to claims for damages, penalties, and termination of contracts, potentially resulting in disruption, limitations, and material adverse effects on the company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. Overall, the increased risk associated with government contracting and regulations may lead to unfavorable conditions for potential investors.</body></html>
