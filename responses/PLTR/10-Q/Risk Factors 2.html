The extracted page from the filing highlights potential risks and factors that may negatively impact the company's liquidity, results of operations, and financial position. The company's expenses are relatively fixed in the short-term and require time to adjust, which means that if revenue falls below expectations in a particular period, the company's results of operations and liquidity would suffer. The table of contents outlines various factors that may cause fluctuations in the company's quarterly results of operations and financial position, such as the success of sales and marketing efforts, termination of one or more large contracts by customers, cyberattacks, and changes in laws and regulations that impact the business, among others.

The seasonality of the company's business may cause continued or increased fluctuations in its results of operations and cash flows, which may prevent it from achieving its quarterly or annual forecasts. Additionally, the company's platforms are complex and may have a lengthy implementation process, and any failure of its platforms to satisfy its customers or perform as desired could harm its business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Overall, the negative factors outlined in the filing suggest that the company may face challenges in maintaining its liquidity and achieving its financial goals. The score is below average as there are several potential risks that could adversely affect the company's financial performance.</body></html>
