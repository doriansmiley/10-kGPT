The information provided in the SEC filing suggests that there are several factors that can negatively impact the company's financial performance. These include the success of sales and marketing efforts, the variability in operating expenses, changes in pricing policies, interruptions or delays in O&M services, cybersecurity incidents, and changes in laws and regulations. The unpredictability and variability of the company's quarterly results and cash flows can also lead to a decline in the trading price of the Class A common stock. The company's business is highly seasonal, and the first quarter generally has relatively lower sales, which may cause fluctuations in financial position. The platforms and services the company offers are complex, which may lead to dissatisfaction by customers if their unique needs are not met. The customers' improper use or configuration of the company's platforms may result in contract terminations or legal claims against the company. The turnover of the company or customer personnel responsible for procurement and use of the company's platforms may also impact the company's ability to make additional sales, thus negatively impacting its business and growth prospects.</body></html>
