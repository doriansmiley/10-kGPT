The information provided in the filing includes several potential negative impacts on the company's ability to maintain its financial performance and customer relationships. These potential negative impacts include the risk of losing government contracts due to failure to comply with security clearance requirements, the termination of significant government contracts, the increased competition and bid protests in a budget-constrained environment, evolving government procurement policies, and changes in pricing criteria that may impact the predictability of margins on contracts. Furthermore, the filing suggests that the company may face disputes or litigation if the U.S. government decides to procure non-commercial developmental items and services instead of commercial items and services. These risks and uncertainties could materially impact the company's future U.S. government business and revenue, and they may adversely affect the company's financial condition, public perception, and growth prospects. Thus, the score is below average.</body></html>
