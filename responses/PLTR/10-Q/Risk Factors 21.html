The information provided in the extracted page has several risks and uncertainties that could have a negative impact on the company's financial performance and shareholder value. 

Firstly, any developments or disputes regarding the company's intellectual property or proprietary rights could lead to legal battles and financial costs. Secondly, completed or announced acquisitions by the company's competitors could affect the company's market share and reduce profitability. Furthermore, changes in management, laws, regulations or accounting standards may also impact the company's operations negatively. 

The exclusive forum provisions in the bylaws, which restrict a stockholder's ability to bring claims against the company, might discourage lawsuits but could also limit a shareholder's legal options. Additionally, sales of substantial amounts of the company's Class A common stock, particularly by directors, executives, and principal stockholders, could lead to a decline in the trading price of the company's stock. 

Finally, the issuance of additional capital stock or securities convertible into the company's capital stock could dilute existing stockholder value and negatively affect the trading price of the company's Class A common stock.</body></html>
