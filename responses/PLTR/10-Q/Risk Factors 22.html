The page extracted from the filing indicates multiple provisions in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company. These provisions could also limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of the company's Class A common stock, affecting the stock's trading price. Additionally, the company's stock trading market could be adversely affected if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about the company, its business, or its market. The multiple class structure of the company's common stock concentrates voting power with certain stockholders, such as the Founders and their affiliates, which could eliminate the ability of other stockholders to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control. Finally, the company does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, and any determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors. 

Overall, these factors could make the investment less attractive to potential investors, leading to a below-average score.</body></html>
