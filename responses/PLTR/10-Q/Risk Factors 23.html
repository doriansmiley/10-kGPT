The excerpt from the 10-K filing indicates several potential risks and drawbacks for investors. 

Firstly, the advance notice procedures that apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company. 

Secondly, the lack of research or unfavorable research published about the company could lead to a decline in its trading price and trading volume, which could negatively impact investors.

Thirdly, the possibility of the company becoming a controlled company as a result of the concentration of voting power among founders and their affiliates could reduce the ability of other stockholders to influence the company's decisions.

Furthermore, the company does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, which could potentially limit the opportunity for investors to realize gains on their investments.

Finally, the multiple class structure of the company's common stock and the Founder Voting Trust Agreement could eliminate the ability of investors to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.

Overall, these risks and drawbacks indicate a negative outlook for potential investors, with a score below average.</body></html>
