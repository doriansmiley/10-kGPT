Summary: 
Based on the information provided, the concentration of voting power among the Founders of the company is a negative factor for a potential investor. The founders and their affiliates effectively control all matters submitted to the stockholders for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, compensation matters, amendments of organizational documents, and any major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. This ownership structure limits the potential for unsolicited merger proposals, unsolicited tender offers, or proxy contests and makes it difficult for stockholders to replace the company's directors or management. Additionally, the founders could have voting power that is substantially greater than their economic interests or the percentage of common stock they hold, which could cause conflicts of interest between the founders and the other stockholders. Furthermore, any future issuances of additional shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will not be subject to approval by the stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the NYSE. Overall, this information is negative for a potential investor, and the score is low compared to an average high-growth company.</body></html>
