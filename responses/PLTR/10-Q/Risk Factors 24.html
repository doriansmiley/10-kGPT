Investors may have concerns over the level of control concentrated in the hands of the company's founders, who can determine the voting outcomes of important decisions, even in the absence of a majority of shareholders. The potential for future dilution through the issuance of additional shares may further reduce the economic interests of shareholders relative to the voting power of the founders. Additionally, while founders may achieve substantial liquidity in their holdings, the interests of the founders and their affiliates may diverge from those of other stockholders, which could lead to conflicts of interest in decision-making. Overall, the level of control and potential for conflicting interests may dampen investor confidence.</body></html>
