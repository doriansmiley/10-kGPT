The information provided in the extracted page highlights several potential drawbacks to investing in the company. Firstly, the structure of the common stock and associated voting rights may limit the power of other shareholders and give Founders significant control over matters affecting the company. Additionally, the company's multi-class capital structure may make it ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, which could limit interest from certain institutional investors. Furthermore, the potential effects of adverse economic conditions or reduced technology spending could negatively impact the company's overall business and financial performance. Finally, natural disasters or other catastrophic events could cause disruptions to the company's operations and lead to potential legal expenses or liabilities. Overall, these factors would suggest a cautious approach by potential investors.</body></html>
