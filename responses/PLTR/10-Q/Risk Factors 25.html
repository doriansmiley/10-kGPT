The information presented in the excerpt shows that the company has a multi-class structure of common stock that favors the founders with significant voting power. This may be seen as negative to potential investors who may want their voting power to be proportional to their ownership. The provisions in the company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation allow for the founders to retain control over matters submitted to a vote of stockholders even if they do not hold the majority of shares. This can be viewed as negative to potential investors who may want to have a more significant say in matters affecting the company. The minimum threshold that must be met on any applicable record date is currently 100,000,000 Corporation Equity Securities, which is a small minority of their outstanding capital stock, but the Ownership Threshold could decrease further as new Corporation Equity Securities are issued. This can be seen as negative as it reduces the threshold for ownership while enabling the founders to maintain significant voting power. Additionally, the shares identified by Mr. Thiel as Designated Foundersâ€™ Excluded Shares are not subject to the Founder Voting Agreement, which could increase Mr. Thiel's or his affiliates' relative voting power compared to other founders. Overall, the information in the excerpt may not be viewed positively by a potential investor.</body></html>
