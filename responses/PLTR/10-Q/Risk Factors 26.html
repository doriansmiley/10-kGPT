Summary:

- The multi-class governance structure may negatively affect the decision by certain institutional investors to purchase or hold shares of our Class A common stock. The holding of low-voting stock, such as our Class A common stock, may not be permitted by the investment policies of certain institutional investors. Furthermore, our multi-class governance structure may make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, which may depress our valuation compared to those of other similar companies that do not have multi-class governance structures.
- Future issuances of our Class A common stock will dilute the voting power of our Class A common stockholders but may not result in further dilution of the voting power of our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement.
- Adverse economic conditions or reduced technology spending may adversely impact our business. Our customers may suffer from reduced operating budgets, which could cause them to defer, reduce, or forego purchases of our platforms or services.
- Exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may impact our financial condition and results of operations.
- Natural disasters, including climate change, and other catastrophic events beyond our control could harm our business. Such events could decrease demand for our services and cause us to incur substantial expense.

Overall, these factors may negatively impact the value of the company and investor's potential returns.</body></html>
