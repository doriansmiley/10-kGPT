The extracted page from the filing highlights several challenges that could adversely affect the company's ability to attract and retain skilled personnel, scale its sales operations, and provide high-quality services to its customers. The company faces intense competition for engineering and other qualified personnel, and it may not be able to offer attractive compensation packages or benefits to potential candidates or current employees. In addition, recruiting and training personnel for specific tasks or contracts may be challenging, especially if the necessary security clearances are delayed or unsuccessful.

The company also needs to successfully build and expand its marketing and sales organization to enter new markets, increase revenue, and retain existing customers. However, identifying, recruiting, training, and managing sales personnel require significant time and resources, and any significant changes to the sales organization or compensation plans may be disruptive and affect revenue growth. 

Furthermore, the company's ability to sell its platforms and services to customers depends on its ability to provide high-quality O&M services and resolve issues in a timely, efficient, and scalable manner. However, the company may face challenges in providing efficient services globally at scale, particularly in non-English speaking regions with different time zones. 

Overall, the challenges highlighted in the filing could negatively affect the company's ability to attract and retain skilled personnel, scale its sales operations, and provide high-quality services to its customers, resulting in slower revenue growth or material decline. Therefore, the rating is negative, and the score is below average compared to an average high-growth company.</body></html>
