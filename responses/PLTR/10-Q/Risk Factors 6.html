Summary:
The company faces significant risks and liabilities due to exclusivity arrangements and unique contractual terms with customers. Intense competition in the market from a significant number of competitors, including larger enterprise software companies and government contractors, may limit the company's growth and negatively impact results. The company faces challenges in maintaining its culture as it grows, and its staffing of customer-facing personnel may result in unintended outcomes. Furthermore, the company's focus on customer outcomes over short-term financial results may lead to decisions that harm its financial performance. The company may not enter into relationships with potential customers if its activities are inconsistent with its organizational mission or values.</body></html>
