Analysis: The information in the extracted filing is negative for a potential investor as it highlights several risks and challenges that could impact the company's financial performance and growth prospects. The company's business model involves offering short-term pilot deployments of its platforms at no or low cost, which sometimes leads to substantial time, effort, and money being spent without producing any sales. Additionally, the success of the earlier stages of the sales cycle depends on factors such as identifying potential customers, agreeing on an appropriate pilot deployment, and executing it successfully. Even if the pilot deployment is successful, the company or the customer may choose not to enter into a larger contract due to several reasons. Large enterprises and government entities, the company's potential customers, have longer implementation cycles, require greater product functionality, and demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks. The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and related challenging macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect the company's business as they have disrupted the operations of its customers and may continue to do so. The use of a hybrid workforce model may also create operational challenges and risks, including difficulties in maintaining company culture, recruitment, retention, and operational efficiency. If the market for the company's platforms and services develops slowly, its growth may stall, and its business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed. Overall, the risks and challenges mentioned in the filing indicate that the company's financial performance and growth prospects may be adversely affected.</body></html>
