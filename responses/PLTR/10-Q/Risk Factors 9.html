Analysis:
Based on the extracted information, an average high growth company could potentially face financial difficulties and limitations due to the company's inability to secure necessary financing to operate and grow as planned. There is also a risk of not being able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all, and such financing may not be sufficient to meet the company's cash needs. The company's credit agreements contain restrictions that could limit its flexibility in operating its business, and its variable rate indebtedness could increase its debt service obligations significantly. Moreover, acquisitions or investments may divert management's attention and come with additional risks, such as unforeseen costs and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses or technologies. Overall, the information suggests that investors may consider the company's financial standing and potential limitations before making investment decisions.</body></html>
