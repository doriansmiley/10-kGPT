Key Negative Points:

2. Risks associated with expansion into new commercial markets and verticals, including regulatory scrutiny and increased business, technology, and economic risks.
3. Uncertainty about securing financing necessary to operate and grow the business as planned or to make acquisitions on favorable terms.
4. Debt agreements contain significant covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on the business, which could limit its ability to react to market conditions and restrict corporate activities.
5. Interest rate risk due to any variable rate indebtedness that the business may incur under its credit facility.
6. Risks associated with investments in companies and technologies, including a partial or complete loss of invested capital, and the inability to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions or investments.
