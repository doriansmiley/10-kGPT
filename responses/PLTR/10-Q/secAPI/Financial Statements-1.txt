The unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date, but does not include all disclosures, including certain notes required by GAAP on an annual reporting basis. In management&#8217;s opinion, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the balance sheets and statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for the interim periods, but are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be anticipated for the full fiscal year or any future period.  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on February 21, 2023.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  Significant estimates and assumptions made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the identification of performance obligations in customer contracts; the valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions; the collectability of contract consideration, including accounts receivable; the useful lives of tangible and intangible assets; the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from business combinations, including intangible assets and goodwill; and the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could affect the Company&#8217;s financial position and results of operations.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on February 21, 2023. There have been no significant changes to these policies during the three months ended March 31, 2023, except for the changes noted below.  Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents primarily consist of amounts invested in money market funds and available-for-sale debt securities.  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  Restricted cash primarily consists of cash and certificates of deposit that are held as collateral against letters of credit and guarantees that the Company is required to maintain for operating lease agreements, certain customer contracts, and other guarantees and financing arrangements.  The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the condensed consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the amounts shown in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):  As of March 31, 2023 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,264,738 &#160; $ 2,269,411 &#160; Restricted cash 11,946 &#160; 33,804 &#160; Restricted cash, noncurrent 12,095 &#160; 29,222 &#160; Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 1,288,779 &#160; $ 2,332,437 &#160;  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses  Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for credit losses. The Company generally grants non-collateralized credit terms to its customers. Allowance for credit losses is based on the Company&#8217;s best estimate of probable losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio and is determined based on expectations of the customer&#8217;s ability to pay by considering factors such as customer type (commercial or government), historical experience, financial position of the customer, age of the accounts receivable, current economic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and reasonable and supportable forward-looking factors about its portfolio and future economic conditions. Accounts receivable are written-off and charged against an allowance for credit losses when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success. Based upon the Company&#8217;s assessment as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an allowance for credit losses of $ 11.3 million and $ 10.1 million, respectively.  Debt Securities  Debt securities are primarily comprised of U.S. treasury securities. The debt securities are classified as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and are reevaluated as of each balance sheet date. The Company considers the majority of its available-for-sale debt securities as available for use in current operations and may sell these securities at any time, and therefore classifies these securities as current assets in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. Debt securities included in marketable securities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets consist of U.S. treasury securities with original maturities of greater than three months at the time of purchase, and the remaining U.S. treasury securities are included in cash and cash equivalents. Interest income on debt securities classified as available-for-sale is included in other income (expense), net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Non-marketable debt securities are recorded at their estimated fair value in other assets with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The majority of the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value each reporting period using quoted prices of similar instruments and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company evaluates investments with unrealized loss positions for other than temporary impairment by assessing if they are related to deterioration in credit risk and whether it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, the Company&#8217;s intent to sell, and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of their cost basis. Credit-related impairment losses, not to exceed the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, are recognized in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized gains and non-credit related losses are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net in the condensed consolidated balance sheets until realized. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  Concentrations of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds and U.S. treasury securities with original maturities of three months or less, which are invested primarily with U.S. financial institutions. Cash deposits with financial institutions, including restricted cash, generally exceed federally insured limits. Management believes minimal credit risk exists with respect to these financial institutions and the Company has not experienced any losses on such amounts.  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  The Company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable presented on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company&#8217;s accounts receivable balances as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $ 254.0 million and $ 258.3 million, respectively. Customer I represented 13 % of total accounts receivable as of March 31, 2023 and no other customers represented more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of March 31, 2023. No customer represented more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022.  For the three months ended March 31, 2023, Customer K, which is in the government operating segment, represented 10 % of total revenue and no other customers represented more than 10% of total revenue for the same period. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, no customer represented 10% or more of total revenue.  3. Contract Liabilities and Remaining Performance Obligations  Contract Liabilities  The Company&#8217;s contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and customer deposits. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 the Company's contract liability balances were $ 427.9 million and $ 339.2 million, respectively. Revenue of $ 192.4 million and $ 187.0 million was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, that was included in the contract liability balances as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Remaining Performance Obligations  The Company&#8217;s arrangements with its customers often have terms that span over multiple years. However, the Company allows many of its customers to terminate contracts for convenience prior to the end of the stated term with less than twelve months&#8217; notice. Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents noncancelable contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and, in certain instances, amounts that will be invoiced. The Company has elected the practical expedient allowing the Company to not disclose remaining performance obligations for contracts with original terms of twelve months or less. Cancelable contracted revenue, which includes customer deposits, is not considered a remaining performance obligation.
