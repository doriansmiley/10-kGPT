Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  1. Organization  Palantir Technologies Inc. (including its subsidiaries, &#8220;Palantir&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in Delaware on May 6, 2003. The Company builds and deploys software platforms that serve as the central operating systems for its customers.  2. Significant Accounting Policies  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) regarding interim financial reporting. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Palantir Technologies Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company holds at least a 20% ownership interest and has the ability to exercise significant influence over, but does not control, the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, loss from operations, net loss, or cash flows. The Company's fiscal year ends on December 31.  The unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date, but does not include all disclosures, including certain notes required by GAAP on an annual reporting basis. In management&#8217;s opinion, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the balance sheets and statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for the interim periods, but are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be anticipated for the full fiscal year or any future period.  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  Significant estimates and assumptions made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the identification of performance obligations in customer contracts; the valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions; the collectability of contract consideration, including accounts receivable; the useful lives of tangible assets; and the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could affect the Company&#8217;s financial position and results of operations.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. There have been no significant changes to these policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.  Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents primarily consist of amounts invested in money market funds.  Restricted cash primarily consists of cash and certificates of deposit that are held as collateral against letters of credit and guarantees that the Company is required to maintain for operating lease agreements, certain customer contracts, and other guarantees and financing arrangements.  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the condensed consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the amounts shown in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):  As of September 30, 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,411,290 &#160; $ 2,335,068 &#160; Restricted cash 20,557 &#160; 41,316 &#160; Restricted cash, noncurrent 20,902 &#160; 46,791 &#160; Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 2,452,749 &#160; $ 2,423,175 &#160;  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses  Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for credit losses. The Company generally grants non-collateralized credit terms to its customers. Allowance for credit losses is based on the Company&#8217;s best estimate of probable losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio and is determined based on expectations of the customer&#8217;s ability to pay by considering factors such as customer type (commercial or government), historical experience, financial position of the customer, age of the accounts receivable, current economic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and reasonable and supportable forward-looking factors about its portfolio and future economic conditions. Accounts receivable are written-off and charged against an allowance for credit losses when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success. Based upon the Company&#8217;s assessment as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the allowances for credit losses were not material.  Concentrations of Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds with original maturities of three months or less, which are invested primarily with U.S. financial institutions. Cash deposits with financial institutions, including restricted cash, generally exceed federally insured limits. Management believes minimal credit risk exists with respect to these financial institutions and the Company has not experienced any losses on such amounts.  The Company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable presented on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company&#8217;s accounts receivable balances as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $ 343.3 million and $ 190.9 million, respectively. Customers J and I represented 17 % and 13 % of total accounts receivable as of September 30, 2022. No other single customer represented more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of September 30, 2022 or December 31, 2021.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, no customer represented more than 10% of total revenue.  3. Contract Liabilities and Remaining Performance Obligations  Contract Liabilities  The Company&#8217;s contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and customer deposits. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company's contract liability balances were $ 460.8 million and $ 463.3 million, respectively. Revenue of $ 353.8 million and $ 347.7 million was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, that was included in the contract liability balances as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  Remaining Performance Obligations  The Company&#8217;s arrangements with its customers often have terms that span over multiple years. However, the Company allows many of its customers to terminate contracts for convenience prior to the end of the stated term with less than twelve months&#8217; notice. Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents noncancelable contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and, in certain instances, amounts that will be invoiced. The Company has elected the practical expedient allowing the Company to not disclose remaining performance obligations for contracts with original terms of twelve months or less. Cancelable contracted revenue, which includes customer deposits, is not considered a remaining performance obligation.  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  The Company&#8217;s remaining performance obligations were $ 1.3 billion as of September 30, 2022, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 44 % as revenue over the next 12 months, 42 % as revenue over the subsequent 13 to 36 months, and the remainder thereafter.  Disaggregation of Revenue  See Note 12. Segment and Geographic Information for disaggregated revenue by customer segment and geographic region.
