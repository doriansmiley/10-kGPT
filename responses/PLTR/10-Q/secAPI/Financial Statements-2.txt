The realized gains and losses from those sales were immaterial. No credit or non-credit losses related to debt securities were recorded as of March 31, 2023. Available-for-sale debt securities of $ 369.8 million were in an unrealized loss position primarily due to unfavorable changes in interest rates subsequent to initial purchase. None of the available-for-sale debt securities held as of March 31, 2023 were in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months. The decline in fair value below amortized cost basis was not considered other than temporary as it is more likely than not that the Company will hold the securities until maturity or a recovery of the cost basis, and no credit-related impairment losses were recorded as of March 31, 2023. All of the Company&#8217;s U.S. treasury securities had contractual maturities due within one year.  As of December 31, 2022, the Company held an immaterial amount of debt securities.
