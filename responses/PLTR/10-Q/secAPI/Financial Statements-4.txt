Income Taxes  The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $ 1.7 million and $ 2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. as well as other tax jurisdictions in which it conducts business. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate as of March 31, 2023 differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign income taxed at different rates, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and valuation allowances recorded on its deferred tax assets from the U.S., United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;), and other jurisdictions . There was no material change in the provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022.  The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in future periods. The Company assesses its ability to realize the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, and it establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company weighs all available positive and negative evidence, including its earnings history and results of recent operations, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. For example, due to the weight of objectively verifiable negative evidence, including its history of U.S. and U.K. net operating tax losses, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that its U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets will not be fully realized. Accordingly, the Company has maintained a full valuation allowance on its U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2023.  11.

Segment and Geographic Information  The following reporting segment tables reflect the results of the Company&#8217;s reportable operating segments consistent with the manner in which the chief operating decision maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;) evaluates the performance of each segment and allocates the Company&#8217;s resources. The CODM does not evaluate the performance of the Company&#8217;s assets on a segment basis for internal management reporting and, therefore, such information is not presented.  Contribution is used, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, each of the segments. A segment&#8217;s contribution is calculated as segment revenue less the related costs of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. It excludes certain operating expenses that are not allocated to segments because they are separately managed at the consolidated corporate level. These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation expense, research and development expenses, and general and administrative expenses.  Financial information for each reportable segment was as follows (in thousands):  Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Revenue: Government $ 289,070 &#160; $ 241,790 &#160; Commercial 236,116 &#160; 204,567 &#160; Total revenue $ 525,186 &#160; $ 446,357 &#160;  Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Contribution: Government $ 166,233 &#160; $ 139,810 &#160; Commercial 112,927 &#160; 112,608 &#160; Total contribution $ 279,160 &#160; $ 252,418 &#160;  The reconciliation of contribution to income (loss) from operations is as follows (in thousands):  Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Income (loss) from operations $ 4,115 &#160; $ ( 39,439 )  Research and development expenses (1)  70,176 &#160; 61,696 &#160;  General and administrative expenses (1)  90,155 &#160; 80,838 &#160; Total stock-based compensation expense 114,714 &#160; 149,323 &#160; Total contribution $ 279,160 &#160; $ 252,418 &#160;  &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;  (1) Excludes stock-based compensation expense.
