 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations, and beliefs, involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. You should review the section titled &#8220;Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; for a discussion of forward-looking statements and the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.  Overview  We build software that empowers organizations to effectively integrate their data, decisions, and operations at scale.  We were founded in 2003 and started building software for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations. We later began working with commercial enterprises, who often faced fundamentally similar challenges in working with data.  We have built three principal software platforms, Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo.  Gotham and Foundry enable institutions to transform massive amounts of information into an integrated data asset that reflects their operations. For over a decade, Gotham has surfaced insights for global defense agencies, the intelligence community, disaster relief organizations and beyond. Foundry is becoming a central operating system not only for individual institutions but also for entire industries.  Apollo, which we began offering as a commercial solution in 2021, is a cloud-agnostic, single control layer that coordinates ongoing delivery of new features, security updates, and platform configurations, helping to ensure the continuous operation of critical systems. Apollo allows our customers to run their software in virtually any environment.  We are in the process of developing and releasing components of our newest offering, the Artificial Intelligence Platform (&#8220;AIP&#8221;). AIP is designed for customers across the commercial and government sectors, enabling them to derive value from recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence via the combination of our existing software platforms with large language models (&#8220;LLMs&#8221;). We believe AIP uniquely allows users to connect LLMs with their data and operations to facilitate decision-making within the legal, ethical, and security constraints that they require.  While our focus in the short term remains on making our software platforms available to increasingly broad swaths of the market, we are also working to identify additional component parts and products embedded within those platforms that have potential as commercial offerings on their own.  We believe that every institution faces challenges that our platforms and products were designed to address. Our approach with all our clients is to establish a partnership that transforms the way they use data in pursuit of their goals.  We regularly evaluate partnerships and investment opportunities in complementary businesses, employee teams, technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our product and service offerings.  Our Business  Our customers pay us to use the software platforms we have built. While we generally offer contract terms of one to five years in length, our customers sometimes enter into shorter-term contracts. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Many of our customer contracts contain termination for convenience provisions.  For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we generated $525.2 million in revenue, reflecting an 18% growth rate from the three months ended March 31, 2022, when we generated $446.4 million in revenue.  In the three months ended March 31, 2023, we generated income from operations of $4.1 million, or adjusted income from operations of $125.1 million when excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes. In the three months ended March 31, 2022, we incurred losses from operations of $39.4 million, or generated adjusted income from operations of $117.4 million when excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes.  In the three months ended March 31, 2023, our gross profit was $417.5 million, reflecting a gross margin of 80%, or 81% when excluding stock-based compensation. In the three months ended March 31, 2022, our gross profit was $352.0 million, reflecting a gross margin of 79%, or 81% when excluding stock-based compensation.  For more information about our adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes; and gross profit and gross margin when excluding stock-based compensation; as well as reconciliations from income (loss) from operations and gross profit, see the section titled &#8220;Non-GAAP Reconciliations&#8221; below .  Our Customers  We define a customer as an organization from which we have recognized revenue during the trailing twelve-month period. During the period ended March 31, 2023, we had 391 customers, including companies in various commercial sectors and government agencies around the world. During the period ended March 31, 2022, we had 277 customers.  For large government agencies, where a single institution has multiple divisions, units, or subsidiary agencies, each such division, unit, or subsidiary agency that enters into a separate contract with us and is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. For example, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Institutes of Health are subsidiary agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, we treat each of those agencies as a separate customer given that the governing structures and procurement processes of each agency are independent.  We have built lasting and significant customer relationships and partnerships with some of the world&#8217;s leading government institutions and companies. Our average revenue for the top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was $50.9 million, which grew 14% from an average of $44.6 million in revenue from the top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022, demonstrating our expanding relationships with existing customers.  Organizations in the commercial and government sectors face similar challenges when it comes to managing data, and we intend to expand our reach in both markets moving forward. Our decisions about which customer relationships require further investment may change over time, based on our assessment of the potential long-term value that our software can generate for them. We enter into initial pilots with customers, generally at our own expense and without a guarantee of future returns, in order to access a unique set of opportunities that others may pass over for lack of resources and shorter investment horizons. We manage customers at the account level, not by industry or sector, so that we can optimize on the specific growth opportunities for each customer. In the three months ended March 31, 2023, 55% of our revenue came from government customers and 45% came from commercial customers.  Our U.S. customers have been a meaningful source of revenue growth for our business. In the three months ended March 31, 2023, we generated 64% of our revenue from customers in the United States and the remaining 36% from non-U.S. customers. Revenue from our U.S. customers during the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was $1.2 billion, which grew 28% from the prior twelve-month period. We expect that U.S. customers will continue to be a source of significant revenue growth for us.  We continue to believe that our government customers remain a meaningful and resilient source of revenue for our business, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. However, large government customers, in particular, are generally subject to a number of uncertainties regarding budgets and spending levels, changes in timing and spending priorities, and regulatory and policy changes, which can make it difficult to predict when, or if, we will make sales to such customers or the size and scope of any contract awards.

Risk Factors&#8221; included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Expansion of Access to Platforms  The speed with which our platforms can be deployed has significantly expanded the range of potential customers with which we plan on partnering over the long term. We anticipate that our reach among an increasingly broad set of customers, in both the commercial and government sectors, will accelerate moving forward. We believe that, as these new partners grow, we will grow with them.  We have also made a number of investments in companies whose businesses rely on the ability of their organizations to manage and analyze data effectively at scale.  Our proximity to these businesses and the industries in which they are operating has enhanced, and is expected to continue enhancing, our own product and business development efforts, as we continue expanding access to our platforms to the broadest possible set of customers.  Macroeconomic Trends  As a corporation with an international presence, we are subject to risks and uncertainties caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, rising inflation and interest rates, monetary policy changes, financial services sector instability, and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, these macroeconomic impacts have generally disrupted the operations of our customers and prospective customers. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape.
