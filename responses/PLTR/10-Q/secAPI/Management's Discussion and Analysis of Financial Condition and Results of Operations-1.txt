See the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the impact of macroeconomic trends on our business.  COVID-19 Impact  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the global economy. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial conditions or results of operations in future periods remains uncertain, but to date has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate. We have reopened our offices and have allowed business travel and in-person events to resume, while continuing to closely monitor developments around the evolving nature of the pandemic. As such, our travel and office-related expenditures have increased, and may continue to increase moving forward. However, we expect that some of our employees will continue to work remotely. The economic effects of the pandemic and resulting societal changes are currently not predictable.  The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear to many of our customers that accommodating the extended timelines ordinarily required to realize results from implementing new software solutions is not an option during a crisis. As a result, customers are increasingly adopting our software, which can be ready in days, over internal software development efforts, which may take months or years.  Russia-Ukraine Conflict  We continue to closely monitor the impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and its global impacts on our business. While the conflict is still evolving and the outcome remains highly uncertain, we do not expect that the Russian invasion will have a material impact on our business and results of operations. We do not currently have office locations in Russia and none of our revenues came from sales to entities headquartered in Russia. In June 2022, our Chief Executive Officer, Alexander Karp, met with the President of Ukraine and other senior officials to discuss opening an office in Ukraine and providing ongoing support. Our current operations related to Ukraine are not material to our financial position or results of operations. However, if the conflict continues or worsens, leading to greater disruptions and uncertainty within the technology industry or global economy, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.  Foreign Currency Exchange Rates  Exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations due to a number of factors, including interest rate changes and political and economic uncertainty which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial position.  Our contracts with customers are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and British pound sterling (&#8220;GBP&#8221;)) has had and could in the future have an unfavorable impact on our revenues from certain non-U.S. customers; however, that impact for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was not material to our financial position or results of operations. Additionally, certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries may hold monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their functional currency (primarily the Japanese Yen (&#8220;JPY&#8221;), Euro and GBP), which could subject our results of operations and cash flows to adverse fluctuations due to changes in such foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the U.S. dollar.  Customer Impacts  Current macroeconomic conditions may also adversely impact our customers&#8217; business, particularly our early- and growth-stage customers. Relationships with early- or growth-stage customers carry inherent risks because, among other things, such customers may be unable to generate sufficient revenues or profitability or to access any necessary financing or funding in a timely manner or on favorable terms to them in the current macroeconomic environment, which has impacted, and may continue to impact, our expected revenue and collections. As a result, current macroeconomic conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our ability to realize the full value of our commercial contracts with such early- or growth-stage customers. For additional information, see Note 4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements in the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Key Business Measure  In addition to the measures presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key non-GAAP business measure to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions.  Contribution Margin  We believe that the revenue we generate relative to the costs we incur in order to generate such revenue is an important measure of the efficiency of our business. We define contribution margin as revenue less our cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, divided by revenue.  Revenue is allocated to each customer account directly. The cost of revenue and sales and marketing costs include both the costs associated with the deployment and operation of our software as well as expenses associated with identifying new customers and expanding partnerships with existing ones. Our software engineers working with existing customers often manage the deployment and operation of our platforms as well as identify new ways that those platforms can be used. To calculate the contribution by segment, we allocate cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, to an account pro rata based on headcount and time spent on the account during the period. To the extent certain costs or personnel are not directly assigned to a specific account, they are allocated pro rata based on total headcount staffed during such period. Direct costs, such as third-party cloud hosting services, are directly allocated to the account to which they relate. Allocated revenues and expenses are then aggregated into a segment based upon the customer account to which they relate.  Contribution margin, both across our business and segments, is intended to capture how much we have earned from customers after accounting for the costs associated with deploying and operating our software, as well as any sales and marketing expenses involved in acquiring and expanding our partnerships with those customers, including allocated overhead. We exclude stock-based compensation as it is a noncash expense.  We believe that our contribution margin provides an important measure of the efficiency of our operations over time. We have included contribution margin because it is a key measure used by our management to evaluate our performance, and we believe that it also provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. Our calculation of contribution margin may differ from similarly titled measures, if any, reported by other companies. Contribution margin should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;).  For more information about contribution margin, including the limitations of this measure, and a reconciliation to income (loss) from operations, see the section titled &#8220;Non-GAAP Reconciliations&#8221; below.  Non-GAAP Reconciliations  We use the non-GAAP measures contribution margin; gross profit and gross margin, excluding stock-based compensation; and adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We exclude stock-based compensation, which is a noncash expense, from these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. Additionally, we exclude employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation as it is difficult to predict and outside of our control.  Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain limitations, as they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Thus, our non-GAAP contribution margin; gross profit and gross margin, excluding stock-based compensation; and adjusted income from operations should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We compensate for these limitations by providing reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  Contribution Margin  The following table provides a reconciliation of contribution margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands, except percentages):  Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Income (loss) from operations $ 4,115 $ (39,439) Add: Research and development expenses (1)  70,176 61,696 General and administrative expenses (1)  90,155 80,838 Total stock-based compensation expense 114,714 149,323 Total contribution $ 279,160 $ 252,418 Contribution margin 53 % 57 %  &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;  (1) Excludes stock-based compensation.
