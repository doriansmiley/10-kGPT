Palantir Cloud  Our Palantir Cloud subscriptions grant customers the right to access the software functionality in a hosted environment controlled by Palantir and are sold together with stand-ready O&#38;M services, as further described below. We agree to provide continuous access to the hosted software throughout the contract term. Revenue associated with Palantir Cloud subscriptions is generally recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis, which is consistent with the transfer of control of the Palantir services to the customer.  On-Premises Software  Sales of our software subscriptions grant customers the right to use functional intellectual property, either on their internal hardware infrastructure or on their own cloud instance, over the contractual term and are also sold together with stand-ready O&#38;M services. O&#38;M services include critical updates and support and maintenance services required to operate the software and, as such, are necessary for the software to maintain its intended utility over the contractual term. Because of this requirement, we have concluded that the software subscriptions and O&#38;M services, which together we refer to as our On-Premises Software, are highly interdependent and interrelated and represent a single distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract. Revenue is generally recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis.  Professional Services  Our professional services support the customers&#8217; use of the software and include, as needed, on-demand user support, user-interface configuration, training, and ongoing ontology and data modeling support. Professional services contracts typically include the provision of on-demand professional services for the duration of the contractual term. These services are typically coterminous with a Palantir Cloud or On-Premises Software subscriptions. Professional services are on-demand, whereby we perform services throughout the contract period; therefore, the revenue is recognized over the contractual term.  Cost of Revenue  Cost of revenue primarily includes salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing O&#38;M and professional services, as well as field-service representatives, third-party cloud hosting services, travel costs, allocated overhead, and other direct costs.  We expect that cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars as our revenue grows and will vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.  Sales and Marketing  Our sales and marketing efforts span all stages of our sales cycle, including personnel involved with sales functions, and executing pilots at new or existing customers. Sales and marketing costs primarily include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for our sales force and personnel involved in sales functions executing on pilots and customer growth activities; as well as third-party cloud hosting services for our pilots, marketing and sales event-related costs, travel costs, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing costs are generally expensed as incurred.  We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our potential and current customers, in growing our business, sales force, and enhancing our brand awareness.  Research and Development  Our research and development efforts are aimed at continuing to develop and refine our platforms, including adding new platforms, features and modules, increasing their functionality, and enhancing the usability of our platforms. Research and development costs primarily include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing the activities to develop and refine our platforms, internal use third-party cloud hosting services and other IT-related costs, travel costs, and allocated overhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  We plan to continue to invest in personnel to support our research and development efforts. As a result, we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest to support these activities.  General and Administrative  General and administrative costs include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative functions, as well as third-party professional services and fees, travel costs, and allocated overhead.  We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we enhance our systems, processes, and controls to support the growth in our business as well as our continuing compliance and reporting requirements as a public company.  Interest Income  Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, U.S. treasury securities, and restricted cash balances.  Interest Expense  Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense and commitment fees incurred under our credit facility.  Other Income (Expense), Net  Other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, realized and unrealized losses from Investments, and our share of income and losses from our equity method investments.  Provision for Income Taxes  Provision for income taxes consists of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business and withholding taxes.  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our joint venture partners&#8217; proportionate share of the results of operations of the respective joint venture.  Segments  We have two operating segments, commercial and government, which were determined based on the manner in which the chief operating decision maker, who is our chief executive officer, manages our operations for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance. Various factors, including our organizational and management reporting structure and customer type, were considered in determining these operating segments.  Our operating segments are described below:  &#8226; Commercial: This segment primarily serves customers working in non-government industries.  &#8226; Government: This segment primarily serves customers that are U.S. government and non-U.S. government agencies.  Segment profitability is evaluated based on contribution and contribution margin. Contribution is segment revenue less the related costs of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense. Contribution margin is contribution divided by revenue. To the extent costs of revenue or sales and marketing expenses are not directly attributable to a particular segment, they are allocated based upon headcount at each operating segment during the period. We use it, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, each of our operating segments, which excludes certain operating expenses that are not allocated to operating segments because they are separately managed at the consolidated corporate level. These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation expense, research and development costs, and general and administrative costs, such as legal and accounting costs.
