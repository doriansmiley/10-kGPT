Revenue from government customers increased by $47.3 million, or 20%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily from customers in the United States. Revenue from U.S. government customers was $229.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $188.1 million for the same period in 2022.

For additional information, see Note 4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Generally, increases in revenue from our existing customers are related to increased adoption of our products and services within their organizations.  Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit  Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2023 2022 Amount % Cost of revenue $ 107,645 $ 94,403 $ 13,242 14 % Gross profit 417,541 351,954 65,587 19 % Gross margin 80 % 79 % 1 %  Cost of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased by $13.2 million, or 14%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increases of $4.4 million in payroll and other payroll-related costs driven by an increase in headcount attributable to our cost of revenue function, and $4.7 million in hardware and $3.5 million for field service representatives mainly related to new projects. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.7 million in stock-based compensation expense and related expenses. For additional information, see the section titled &#8220;Stock-Based Compensation&#8221; below.  Our gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased from 79% for the same period in 2022 to 80% as a result of revenue growth outpacing costs of revenue. The primary cause of this growth rate variation was the decrease in stock-based compensation expense and related expenses in cost of revenue relative to total expense growth as compared to the prior year.  Operating Expenses  Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2023 2022 Amount % Sales and marketing $ 187,093 $ 160,485 $ 26,608 17 % Research and development 90,100 88,601 1,499 2 % General and administrative 136,233 142,307 (6,074) (4) % Total operating expenses $ 413,426 $ 391,393 $ 22,033 6 %  Sales and Marketing  Sales and marketing expenses increased by $26.6 million, or 17%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increases of $26.8 million in payroll and other payroll-related costs driven by an increase in headcount attributable to our sales and marketing function and $10.5 million in travel and office-related  costs. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $10.1 million in stock-based compensation expense and related expenses and $3.5 million in marketing costs. For additional information related to stock-based compensation expense, see the section titled &#8220;Stock-Based Compensation&#8221; below.  Research and Development  Research and development expenses increased by $1.5 million, or 2%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increases of $4.2 million in third-party cloud hosting services, other IT costs, and office-related expenses and $4.1 million in payroll and other payroll-related costs primarily driven by an increase in headcount attributable to our research and development function. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $7.5 million in stock-based compensation expense and related expenses. For additional information, see the section titled &#8220;Stock-Based Compensation&#8221; below.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses decreased by $6.1 million, or 4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $15.6 million in stock-based compensation expense and related expenses. For additional information, see the section titled &#8220;Stock-Based Compensation&#8221; below. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $8.6 million in payroll and other payroll-related costs driven by an increase in headcount attributable to our general and administrative functions.  Stock-Based Compensation  Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2023 2022 Amount % Cost of revenue $ 9,177 $ 11,677 $ (2,500) (21) % Sales and marketing 39,535 49,272 (9,737) (20) % Research and development 19,924 26,905 (6,981) (26) % General and administrative 46,078 61,469 (15,391) (25) % Total stock-based compensation expense $ 114,714 $ 149,323 $ (34,609) (23) %  Stock-based compensation expenses decreased by $34.6 million, or 23%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was driven by lower expense under the accelerated attribution method for restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) granted prior to September 30, 2020, the date of our direct listing, during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, as well as lower expense due to options becoming fully vested and the cancellation of options and RSUs.  Interest Income  Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2023 2022 Amount Interest income $ 20,853 $ 547 $ 20,306  Interest income increased by $20.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to an increase in U.S. interest rates on interest earned from our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash; and new investments in U.S. treasury securities.  Interest Expense  Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2023 2022 Amount Interest expense $ (1,275) $ (594) $ (681)  Interest expense increased by $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the amortization of upfront debt issuance costs.  Other Income (Expense), Net  Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2023 2022 Amount Other income (expense), net $ (2,861) $ (59,870) $ 57,009  Other income (expense), net changed by $57.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to net decrease in losses from our shares held in publicly-traded equity securities.  Provision for Income Taxes  Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2023 2022 Amount Provision for income taxes $ 1,681 $ 2,023 $ (342)  There was no material change in the provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We generated positive cash flow from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023. We had cash and cash equivalents and short-term U.S. treasury securities totaling $2.9 billion available as of March 31, 2023. We believe that cash flows generated from operations, cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, available funds and access to financing sources, including our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. We have historically generated significant losses from our operations as reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and we expect cash flow from operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future. Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of our equity securities, including proceeds from option exercises, and payments received from our customers.  As of March 31, 2023, our accumulated deficit balance was $5.8 billion, and our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents and short-term U.S. treasury securities totaling $2.9 billion.  As of March 31, 2023, we had no outstanding debt balances and additional available and undrawn revolving and delayed draw term loan (&#8220;DDTL&#8221;) commitments of $950.0 million under our credit facility. For more information, see Note 6. Debt in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q .  Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the rate of our growth, our ability to attract and retain customers and their willingness and ability to pay for our products and services, and the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to market and develop our products. Further, we may enter into future arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services, strategic partnerships, and technologies. As such, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If additional funds are not available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
