&#8226; The transaction may involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience or where competitors have stronger market positions;  &#8226; An acquisition may require us to comply with additional laws and regulations, or to engage in substantial remediation efforts to cause the acquired company to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or result in liabilities resulting from the acquired company&#8217;s failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations;  &#8226; Our use of cash to pay for the transaction would limit other potential uses for our cash;  &#8226; If we incur debt to fund such a transaction, such debt may subject us to material restrictions on our ability to conduct our business as well as financial maintenance covenants; and  &#8226; To the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with such transactions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease.  We have made and may continue to make strategic investments pursuant to Investment Agreements to purchase, or commit to purchase, securities of Investees, including privately-held or publicly-traded entities; however, we do not currently anticipate entering into new Investment Agreements to purchase, or commit to purchase, securities of special purpose acquisition companies.  Additionally, in connection with approving and signing the Investment Agreements, we and each Investee or an associated entity entered into a commercial contract for access to our products and services. The terms of such contracts, including these  Table of contents  contractual options, range from three to ten years. Many of these commercial contracts are subject to various termination provisions, including, as applicable, for cause. Parties to certain of these and other commercial contracts entered into in connection with our Investments may elect to exercise termination rights, to the extent applicable, which would negatively impact our expected revenue and collections. The total value of such commercial contracts is $754.9 million, which is inclusive of $116.2 million of contractual options. As of September 30, 2022, the cumulative amount of revenue recognized from commercial contracts with Investees was $147.0 million of which $98.7 million of revenue was recognized by us from the commercial contracts during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.  If the companies that we enter into commercial contracts with are unable to generate sufficient revenues or profitability or to access any necessary financing or funding in a timely manner or on favorable terms to them, our commercial contracts and expected revenue and collections would be negatively impacted. These companies may be engaged in businesses that involve novel and unproven technologies, products, and services and such companies may be unable to perform their obligations under any commercial contracts that we enter into with them in a timely manner or at all.  Our ability to sell or transfer, or realize value from our Investments may be limited by applicable securities laws and regulations, including the requirement that offers or sales of securities must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) pursuant to applicable laws or qualify for an exemption from such registration, and our ability to liquidate and realize value from our Investments may be negatively and materially impacted by any delays or limitations on our ability to offer, sell, or transfer our Investments. In addition, our Investments are speculative in nature and may be volatile or decline in value or be entirely lost. We have realized, and may continue to realize, losses related to these marketable securities, which could have a negative impact on our future financial position, results of operations, earnings per share, and cash flows.  The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities.  Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Information Technology, Data Privacy, and Security  If any of the systems of any third parties upon which we rely, our customers&#8217; cloud or on-premises environments, or our internal systems, are breached or if unauthorized access to customer or third-party data is otherwise obtained, public perception of our platforms and O&#38;M services may be harmed, and we may lose business and incur losses or liabilities.  Our success depends in part on our ability to provide effective data security protection in connection with our technology platforms and services, and we rely on information technology networks and systems to securely store, transmit, index, and otherwise process electronic information. Because our platforms and services are used by our customers to store, transmit, index, or otherwise process and analyze large data sets that often contain proprietary, confidential, and/or sensitive information (including in some instances personal or identifying information and personal health information), our software is perceived as an attractive target for attacks by computer hackers or others seeking unauthorized access, and our software faces threats of unintended exposure, exfiltration, alteration, deletion, loss, or unavailability of data. Additionally, because many of our customers use our platforms to store, transmit, and otherwise process proprietary, confidential, or sensitive information, and complete mission critical tasks, they have a lower risk tolerance for security vulnerabilities in our platforms and services than for vulnerabilities in other, less critical, software products and services.  Our platforms and services operate in conjunction with, and we are dependent upon, third-party products and components across a broad ecosystem, including our customer environments. There have been and may continue to be significant attacks on certain third-party providers, and we cannot guarantee that our or any third-party providers&#8217; systems and networks have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support or otherwise interface with us and our platforms and services. If there is a security vulnerability, error, or other bug in one of these third-party products or components and if there is a security exploit targeting them, we could face increased costs, claims, liability, reduced revenue, and harm to our reputation or competitive position. The natural sunsetting or phasing out of third-party products and operating systems that we use requires that our infrastructure teams reallocate time and attention to migration and updates, during which period potential security vulnerabilities could be exploited. In addition, our software is deployed on-premises at customer sites and in other locations where we may not have full control over how our products are deployed or managed. If our products are not appropriately secured in these environments, they could be compromised, inappropriately accessed, or undergo unauthorized copying and distribution, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, as we increase the number of customers we serve on our cloud environment, the likelihood increases that some usage of our products may occur that violates our terms of service or is otherwise improper or perceived as improper, which could cause reputational damage and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  We, and the third-party vendors upon which we rely, have experienced, and may in the future experience, cybersecurity attacks and threats, including threats or attempts to disrupt our information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain  Table of contents  access to sensitive or confidential information. Our and our third-party vendors&#8217; technology systems may be damaged, disrupted, or compromised by malicious events, such as cyberattacks (including computer viruses, ransomware, and other malicious and destructive code, phishing attacks, and denial of service attacks), physical or electronic security breaches, natural disasters, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, personnel misconduct, and human error. Such attacks or security breaches may be perpetrated by internal bad actors, such as employees or contractors, or by third parties (including traditional computer hackers, persons involved with organized crime, or foreign state or foreign state-supported actors). Cybersecurity threats can employ a wide variety of methods and techniques, which may include the use of social engineering techniques or supply-chain attacks, are constantly evolving, and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated; all of which increase the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until after they are launched against a target, we and our third-party vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Although prior known cyberattacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results, and we are continuing to bolster our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures, we cannot guarantee that past, future, or ongoing cyberattacks or other security breaches or incidents against us or a third party, if successful, will not have a material impact on our business or financial results, whether directly or indirectly. For instance, due to political uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and military actions associated with Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, we and our third-party vendors may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks, phishing attacks, viruses, malware, ransomware, hacking or similar breaches and incidents from nation-state actors or affiliated actors, including attacks that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell, and distribute our products and services. While we have security measures in place to protect our information and our customers&#8217; information and to prevent data loss and other security breaches and incidents, we have not always been able to do so and there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to anticipate or prevent security breaches or incidents, or unauthorized access of our information technology systems or the information technology systems of the third-party vendors upon which we rely. Despite our implementation of network security measures and internal information security policies, data stored on personnel computer systems is also
