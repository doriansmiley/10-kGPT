&#8226; any such transactions may negatively affect our financial results because it may require us to incur charges or assume substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose us to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims and disputes, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to such transactions;  &#8226; costs and potential difficulties associated with the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business;  &#8226; we may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, infrastructure, products, personnel, or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us or if we are unable to retain key personnel, if their technology is not easily adapted to work with ours, or if we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership, management, or otherwise;  &#8226; we may not realize the expected benefits of the transaction;  &#8226; an acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses, result in unfavorable public perception, and distract our management;  &#8226; an acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of customer purchases for both us and the company acquired due to customer uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of service from either company;  &#8226; the potential impact on relationships with existing customers, vendors, and distributors as business partners as a result of acquiring another company or business that competes with or otherwise is incompatible with those existing relationships;  &#8226; the potential that our due diligence of the applicable company or business does not identify significant problems or liabilities, or that we underestimate the costs and effects of identified liabilities;  &#8226; exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, the transaction, including but not limited to claims from former employees, customers, or other third parties, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our business faces;  &#8226; potential goodwill impairment charges related to acquisitions;  &#8226; we may encounter difficulties in, or may be unable to, successfully sell any acquired products;  &#8226; the transaction may involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience or where competitors have stronger market positions;  &#8226; an acquisition may require us to comply with additional laws and regulations, or to engage in substantial remediation efforts to cause the acquired company to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or result in liabilities resulting from the acquired company&#8217;s failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations;  &#8226; our use of cash to pay for the transaction would limit other potential uses for our cash;  &#8226; if we incur debt to fund such a transaction, such debt may subject us to material restrictions on our ability to conduct our business as well as financial maintenance covenants; and  &#8226; to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with such transactions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease.  We have made and may continue to make strategic investments pursuant to certain approved agreements (&#8220;Investment Agreements&#8221;) to purchase, or commit to purchase, shares of various entities, including special purpose acquisition companies and/or other privately-held or publicly-traded entities (each, an &#8220;Investee,&#8221; and such purchases, the &#8220;Investments&#8221;); however, we do not currently anticipate entering into new Investment Agreements to purchase, or commit to purchase, securities of special purpose acquisition companies. However, we have accepted, and may continue to accept, securities as noncash compensation.  Additionally, in connection with approving and signing the Investment Agreements, we and each Investee or an associated entity entered into a commercial contract for access to our products and services (collectively, the &#8220;Strategic Commercial Contracts&#8221;). As of March 31, 2023, the terms of such Strategic Commercial Contracts, including contractual options, range from two to seven years and are subject to termination for cause provisions. The total value of such Strategic Commercial Contracts as of March 31, 2023 was $390.3 million, inclusive of $43.7 million of contractual options. When determining the total value of these Strategic Commercial Contracts, we assess customers&#8217; financial condition, including the consideration of their ability and intention to pay, and whether all or some portion of the value of the contracts continue to meet the criteria for revenue recognition, among other factors. As a result of these assessments, the above $390.3 million of total value of Strategic Commercial Contracts excludes an aggregate of $102.4 million of the value of certain contracts when compared to the amounts as of December 31, 2022. Certain companies with which we have entered into commercial contracts have been, and may continue to be, unable to generate sufficient revenues or profitability or to access any necessary financing or funding in a timely manner or on favorable terms to them, which has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our expected revenue and collections. These companies are generally engaged in businesses that involve novel and unproven technologies, products, and services and such companies have been, and may continue to be, unable to perform all or some of their obligations under any commercial contracts that we enter into with them in a timely manner or at all. For example, some of our early-stage Investee customers recently filed for bankruptcy, and the remaining value of the commercial contracts with such customers that is not expected to be recognized as revenue has been excluded from the total value of Strategic Commercial Contracts above. As of March 31, 2023, the cumulative amount of revenue recognized from Strategic Commercial Contracts was $200.1 million, of which $33.4 million was recognized by us during the three months ended March 31, 2023.  Our ability to sell or transfer, or realize value from our Investments may be limited by applicable securities laws and regulations, including the requirement that offers or sales of securities must be registered with the SEC pursuant to applicable laws or qualify for an exemption from such registration, and our ability to liquidate and realize value from our Investments may be negatively and materially impacted by any delays or limitations on our ability to offer, sell, or transfer our Investments. In addition, our Investments are speculative in nature and may be volatile or decline in value or be entirely lost. We have realized, and may continue to realize, losses related to these equity securities, which could have a negative impact on our future financial position, results of operations, earnings per share, and cash flows.  The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities.  Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Information Technology, Data Privacy, and Security  If any of the systems of any third parties upon which we rely, our customers&#8217; cloud or on-premises environments, or our internal systems, are breached or if unauthorized access to customer or third-party data is otherwise obtained, public perception of our platforms and O&#38;M services may be harmed, and we may lose business and incur losses or liabilities.  Our success depends in part on our ability to provide effective data security protection in connection with our technology platforms and services, and we rely on information technology networks and systems to securely store, transmit, index, and otherwise process electronic information. Because our platforms and services are used by our customers to store, transmit, index, or otherwise process and analyze large data sets that often contain proprietary, confidential, and/or sensitive information  (including in some instances personal or identifying information and personal health information), our software is perceived as an attractive target for attacks by computer hackers or others seeking unauthorized access, and our software faces threats of unintended exposure, exfiltration, alteration, deletion, loss, or unavailability of data. Additionally, because many of our customers use our platforms to store, transmit, and otherwise process proprietary, confidential, or sensitive information, and complete mission critical tasks, they have a lower risk tolerance for security vulnerabilities in our platforms and services than for vulnerabilities in other, less critical, software products and services.  Our platforms and services operate in conjunction with, and we are dependent upon, third-party products and components across a broad ecosystem, including our customer environments. There have been and may continue to be significant attacks on certain third-party providers, and we cannot guarantee that our or any third-party providers&#8217; systems and networks have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support or otherwise interface with us and our platforms and services. If there is a security vulnerability, error, or other bug in one of these third-party products or components and if there is a security exploit targeting them, we could face increased costs, claims, liability, reduced revenue, and harm to our reputation or competitive position. The natural sunsetting or phasing out of third-party products and operating systems that we use requires that our infrastructure teams reallocate time and attention to migration and updates, during which period potential security vulnerabilities could be exploited. In addition, our software is deployed on-premises at customer sites and in other locations where we may not have full control over how our products are deployed or managed. If our products are not appropriately secured in these environments, they could be compromised, inappropriately accessed, or undergo
