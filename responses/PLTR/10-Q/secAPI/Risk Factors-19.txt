may be adversely impacted.  Provisions enacted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental (&#8220;R&#38;E&#8221;) expenditures became effective on January 1, 2022. Beginning January 1, 2022, all U.S. and non-U.S. based R&#38;E expenditures must be capitalized and amortized over five years and 15 years, respectively. Beginning January 1, 2022, we began capitalizing and amortizing R&#38;E expenditures over five years for domestic research and 15 years for international research rather than expensing these costs as incurred.  Many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#8217;s (&#8220;OECD&#8221;) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The OECD is also continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the &#8220;Pillar One&#8221; and &#8220;Pillar Two&#8221; proposals). The Council of the European Union has adopted the global corporate 15% minimum tax as provided for in Pillar Two and has directed EU member states to implement legislation enacting Pillar Two by December 31, 2023. As a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies, regulations or guidance, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially adversely affect our business, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally.  We may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  We record an asset for the future tax benefits from unused U.S. federal, state, and non-U.S. net operating losses (&#8220;NOLs&#8221;) and tax credits subject to a full valuation allowance. Federal, state, and non-U.S. taxing bodies often place limitations on NOLs and tax credit carryforward benefits. As a result, we may not be able to utilize our NOLs and tax credits. In general, under Section 382 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. If our existing NOLs are subject to limitations arising from an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs could be limited by Section 382 of the Code, and a certain amount of our prior year NOLs could expire without benefit. Changes in the law may also impact our ability to use our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards.  There is also a risk that the expiration of our existing NOLs or tax credits or a limitation on their use to offset future income tax liabilities could result from statutory or regulatory changes, especially in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Our results of operations may be harmed if we are required to collect sales or other related taxes for our license arrangements in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so.  States and some local taxing jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. We collect and remit U.S. sales and use tax, value-added tax (&#8220;VAT&#8221;), and goods and services tax (&#8220;GST&#8221;) in a number of jurisdictions. It is possible, however, that we could face sales tax, VAT, or GST audits and that our liability for these taxes could exceed our estimates as state and non-U.S. tax authorities could still assert that we are obligated to collect additional tax amounts from our customers and remit those taxes to those authorities. We could also be subject to audits in states and non-U.S. jurisdictions for which we have not accrued tax liabilities. One or more states or countries may seek to impose incremental or new sales, use, or other tax collection obligations on us or may determine that such taxes should have, but have not been, paid by us.  Risks Related to Relationships and Business with the Public Sector  A significant portion of our business depends on sales to the public sector, and our failure to receive and maintain government contracts or changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of the public sector has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.  We derive a significant portion of our revenue from contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign governments and government agencies, and we believe that the success and growth of our business will continue to depend on our successful procurement of government contracts. For example, we have historically derived, and expect to continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenue from sales to agencies of the U.S. federal government, either directly by us or through other government contractors. Our perceived relationship with the U.S. government could adversely affect our business prospects in certain non-U.S. geographies or with certain non-U.S. governments.  Sales to such government agencies are subject to a number of challenges and risks. Selling to government agencies can be highly competitive, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. We also must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts, which provide public sector customers rights, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts.  Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects may be adversely affected by certain events or activities, including, but not limited to:  &#8226; changes in fiscal or contracting policies or decreases in available government funding;  &#8226; changes in government programs or applicable requirements;  &#8226; restrictions in the grant of personnel security clearances to our employees;  &#8226; ability to maintain facility clearances required to perform on classified contracts for U.S. federal government and foreign government agencies;  &#8226; ability to achieve or maintain one or more government certifications, including, but not limited to, our existing FedRAMP, IL2, IL4, IL5, and IL6 authorizations;  &#8226; changes in the political environment, including before or after a change to the leadership within the government administration, or due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and related economic sanctions and regional instability, and any resulting uncertainty or changes in policy or priorities and resultant funding;  &#8226; changes in the government&#8217;s attitude towards the capabilities that we offer, especially in the areas of national defense, cybersecurity, and critical infrastructure, including the financial, energy, telecommunications, and healthcare sectors;  &#8226; changes in the government&#8217;s attitude towards us as a company or our platforms as viable or acceptable software solutions;  &#8226; appeals, disputes, or litigation relating to government procurement, including but not limited to bid protests by unsuccessful bidders on potential or actual awards of contracts to us or our partners by the government;  &#8226; the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations;  &#8226; budgetary constraints, including automatic reductions as a result of &#8220;sequestration&#8221; or similar measures and constraints imposed by any lapses in appropriations for the federal government or certain of its departments and agencies;  &#8226; influence by, or competition from, third parties with respect to pending, new, or existing contracts with government customers;  &#8226; changes in political or social attitudes with respect to security or data privacy issues;  &#8226; potential delays or changes in the government appropriations or procurement processes, including as a result of events such as war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, and public health concerns or epidemics, such as the coronavirus pandemic; and  &#8226; increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays caused by other factors outside of our control, such as performance failures of our subcontractors.  Such events or activities, among others, have caused and could continue to cause governments and governmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing our platforms and services in the future, reduce the size or payment amounts of purchases from existing or new government customers, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.  We have contracts with governments that involve classified programs, which may limit investor insight into portions of our business.  We derive a portion of our revenue from programs with governments and government agencies that are subject to security restrictions (e.g., contracts involving classified information, classified contracts, and classified programs), which preclude the dissemination of information and technology that is classified for national security purposes under applicable law and regulation. In general, access to classified information, technology, facilities, or programs requires appropriate personnel security clearances, is subject to additional contract oversight and potential liability, and may also require appropriate facility clearances and other specialized infrastructure. In the event of a security incident involving classified information, technology, facilities, or programs or personnel holding clearances, we may be subject to legal, financial, operational, and reputational harm. We are limited in our ability to provide specific information about these classified programs, their risks, or any disputes or claims relating to such programs. As a result, investors have less insight into our classified programs than our other businesses and therefore less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to our classified business or our business overall. However, historically the business risks associated with our work on classified programs have not differed materially from those of our other government contracts.
