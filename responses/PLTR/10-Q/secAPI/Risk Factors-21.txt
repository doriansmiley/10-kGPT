customers and could also result in negative publicity, which could harm customer and public perception of our business. The enforcement of FASA has resulted in a significant increase in our business with the U.S. federal government. Any change in or repeal of FASA, or a contrary interpretation of FASA by a court of competent jurisdiction, would adversely affect our competitive position for U.S. federal government contracts.  A decline in the U.S. and other government budgets, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, or delays in contract awards have affected and may continue to significantly and adversely affect our future revenue and limit our growth prospects.  Because we generate a substantial portion of our revenue from contracts with governments and government agencies, and in particular from contracts with the U.S. government and government agencies, our results of operations could be adversely affected by government spending caps or changes in government budgetary priorities, as well as by delays in the government budget process, program starts, or the award of contracts or orders under existing contract vehicles, including as a result of a new U.S. administration. Current U.S. government spending levels for defense-related and other programs may not be sustained beyond government fiscal year 2023. Future spending and program authorizations may not increase or may decrease or shift to programs in areas in which we do not provide services or are less likely to be awarded contracts. Such changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities may occur as a result of shifts in spending priorities from defense-related and other programs as a result of competing demands for federal funds and the number and intensity of military conflicts or other factors.  The U.S. government also conducts periodic reviews of U.S. defense strategies and priorities which may shift Department of Defense budgetary priorities, reduce overall spending, or delay contract or task order awards for defense-related programs from which we would otherwise expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenue. A significant decline in overall U.S. government spending, a significant shift in spending priorities, the substantial reduction or elimination of particular defense-related programs, or significant budget-related delays in contract or task order awards for large programs have affected and could continue to adversely affect our future revenue and limit our growth prospects.  Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock  The public trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.  Prior to the listing of our Class A common stock, there was no public market for shares of our Class A common stock. The market prices of the securities of other recently public companies have historically been highly volatile. The public trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and may in the future be, subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, including those listed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock since you might be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the public trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:  &#8226; the number of shares of our Class A common stock publicly owned and available for trading;  &#8226; price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;  &#8226; volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;  &#8226; changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;  &#8226; sales or expected sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;  &#8226; short-selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative securities;  &#8226; failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;  &#8226; any financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;  &#8226; announcements by us or our competitors of new platforms, products, services or capabilities;  &#8226; the public&#8217;s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;  &#8226; rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;  &#8226; actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;  &#8226; actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors&#8217; businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;  &#8226; litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;  &#8226; actual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;  &#8226; developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;  &#8226; announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services or technologies by us or our competitors;  &#8226; changes in our management, including any departures of one of our Founders;  &#8226; new laws or regulations, public expectations regarding new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;  &#8226; changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;  &#8226; any significant change in our management;  &#8226; other events or factors, including those resulting from war, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or responses to these events; and  &#8226; general macroeconomic conditions, such as rising inflation and interest rates and slow or negative growth of our markets.  In addition, stock markets, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the trading prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies, including technology companies, have fluctuated in a manner often unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the trading price of a particular company&#8217;s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation, including the recent purported class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits filed against us and certain of our officers and directors, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management&#8217;s attention and resources and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, in the future, we may be the target of additional litigation of this type.  Our amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, and also provide that the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, each of which could limit our stockholders&#8217; ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, stockholders, or employees.  Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, stockholders, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (c) any action or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to, or seeking to enforce any right, obligation or remedy under, any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws, (d) any action or proceeding as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (e) any action or proceeding asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court in Delaware or, if no state court in Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) and any appellate court therefrom, in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over the claims at issue and the indispensable parties; provided that the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act.  Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.
