Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding or owning (or continuing to hold or own) any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing bylaw provisions. Although we believe these exclusive forum provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws in the types of lawsuits to which each applies, the exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims against us and our current and former directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum provisions. Further, in the event a court finds either exclusive forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.  Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets or the perception that sales might occur, including sales by our Founders and their affiliates, could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.  Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets or the perception that sales might occur, could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.  In addition to the supply and demand and volatility risk factors discussed above, sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock into the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur in large quantities, could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline. As of March 31, 2023, approximately 6.2 million options will expire through December 2023 if not exercised prior to their respective expiration dates, and we expect many holders will elect to exercise such options prior to expiration. Upon exercise, the holders will receive shares of our Class A or Class B common stock, which may subsequently be sold.  As of March 31, 2023, there were 2,013,043,925 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding, 103,680,894 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding and 1,005,000 shares of our Class F common stock outstanding. Substantially all of these shares may be immediately sold, although sales by our affiliates remain subject to compliance with the volume limitations of Rule 144.  Further, as of March 31, 2023, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 131,038,441 shares of our Class A common stock and 189,646,518 shares of our Class B common stock, and 71,234,336 shares of our Class A common stock and 45,825,000 shares of Class B common stock subject to RSUs. All shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans have been registered for sale under the Securities Act. Subject to compliance with Rule  144 or the availability of an alternative exemption, the shares issued upon exercise of stock options or upon settlement of RSUs will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.  While the registration rights of our non-affiliates pursuant to our Amended and Restated Investors&#8217; Rights Agreement dated August 24, 2020 requiring us to register shares owned by them for public sale in the United States have expired under the terms of that agreement, our affiliates who are party to the Amended and Restated Investors&#8217; Rights Agreement, including our Founders and certain of the entities affiliated with Peter Thiel, will retain the right to cause us to register shares held by them for resale until such rights terminate in accordance with our Amended and Restated Investors&#8217; Rights Agreement. Any registration statement we file to register additional shares, whether as a result of registration rights or otherwise and whether in connection with the exercise of stock options, the settlement of RSUs, or the exercise or settlement of other awards or otherwise, could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline or be volatile.  We also may issue our capital stock or securities convertible into our capital stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.  Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened acquisition of the Company, which will likely depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.  Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:  &#8226; our multi-class common stock structure, which provides our Founders and their affiliates with the ability to effectively control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock;  &#8226; prior to the Final Class F Conversion Date (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation), the holders of our common stock will only be able to take action by written consent if the action also receives the affirmative consent of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class F common stock, and after such point the holders of our common stock will only be able to take action at a meeting of the stockholders and will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;  &#8226; from and after the Final Class F Conversion Date, our Board of Directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;  &#8226; our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;  &#8226; certain transactions, other than restructuring transactions or transactions that otherwise do not involve a Change of Control (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation), which transactions require, pursuant to Section 251(c) or Section 271(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the approval of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote thereon, will require approval by the holders of at least 55.0% of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote thereon if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote to approve such transaction occurs prior to the Final Class F Conversion Date;  &#8226; certain transactions prior to the Final Class F Conversion Date, that would require disclosure pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, between any of our Founders (or their controlled affiliates), on the one hand, and us, on the other, in which consideration exchanges hands between our Founders (or their controlled affiliates) and us, and such consideration has a fair market value in excess of $50.0 million as determined in accordance with our amended and restated bylaws will require approval by either (i) the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock, voting together as a single class, or (ii) an Independent Committee (as defined in our amended and restated bylaws);  &#8226; the acquisition of our equity securities by our Founders (including their controlled affiliates), prior to the Final Class F Conversion Date, in a &#8220;Rule 13e-3 transaction&#8221; (as defined in Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act) will be conditioned on approval by (i) an Independent Committee and (ii) the holders of a majority of the voting power of our capital stock that is held by our stockholders other than the Founders (including their controlled affiliates) and any holder of the Class F Common Stock;  &#8226; vacancies on our Board of Directors will be able to be filled only by our Board of Directors and not by stockholders;  &#8226; our directors may only be removed as provided in the Delaware General Corporation Law;  &#8226; a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer, our President, or our Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directorships, whether or not there exist any vacancies or other unfilled seats in previously authorized directorships;  &#8226; our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders, except that any designation and issuance of preferred stock must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class F common stock; and
