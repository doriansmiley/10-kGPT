In addition, part of our growth strategy involves supporting a broader set of potential customers, including early- and growth-stage companies. Sales to early- and growth-stage companies often involve risks that vary from those present with sales to large or otherwise established organizations, due to their limited operating history, limited resources for adopting new technologies,  Table of contents  and uncertain resources for future operations, among other things. Accordingly, we will continue to refine our business strategy and pricing structures to attract and retain such customers, as well as existing and larger customers across the potential customer base. There is no guarantee that our existing or proposed business strategies, including subscription-based or usage-based pricing structures, will achieve broad adoption by current or prospective customers or be appropriately structured to attract and retain early- and growth-stage companies or other potential customers across the customer base.  If we are not successful in executing our sales strategy, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects could be adversely affected.  The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected our business and operations.  As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to take precautionary measures to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation, these precautionary measures included temporarily closing our offices worldwide and virtualizing, postponing, or canceling customer, employee, or industry events. More recently and in accordance with relevant public health guidance and local conditions, we reopened our offices and resumed travel, while continuing to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic to determine if additional actions or adjustments to our current policies are required. While the COVID-19 pandemic has provided certain new opportunities for our business to expand, it has also created many negative headwinds that present risks to our business and results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has generally disrupted the operations of our customers and prospective customers, and may continue to disrupt their operations, including as a result of travel restrictions and/or business shutdowns, uncertainty in the financial markets or other harm to their business and financial results, which could result in a reduction to information technology budgets, delayed purchasing decisions, longer sales cycles, extended payment terms, delayed payments, and postponed or canceled projects, all of which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including sales and cash flows. We do not yet know the net impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and cannot guarantee that it will not be materially negative. Although we continue to monitor the pandemic and may adjust our current policies as information and relevant public health guidance evolves, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the precautionary measures and policies that we have adopted in response to the pandemic may create operational and other challenges, any of which could harm our business and results of operations.  Historically, a significant portion of our field sales, operations and maintenance, and professional services have been conducted in person. As a result of certain work and travel restrictions implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, the precautionary measures we adopted, and the increased availability of remote methods of customer support, many of our field sales and professional services activities are still being conducted remotely, which has resulted in a decrease in our travel and office expenditures. However, our travel and office-related expenditures have increased, and may continue to increase in the future, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we do not yet know the extent of the negative impact of such restrictions and precautionary measures on our ability to attract new customers or retain and expand our relationships with existing customers.  Although the majority of our workforce worked remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was minimal disruption in our ability to ensure the effective operation of our software platforms. We have reopened our offices and are allowing business travel to resume, while continuing to closely monitor the pandemic, and some of our employees continue to work remotely. It is possible that remote work arrangements may have a negative impact on our operations; the execution of our business plans; our ability to recruit, train, manage, and retain employees; our ability to maintain and strengthen our company culture; the productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business; and on third-party service providers who perform critical services for us, or otherwise cause operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by the pandemic and related governmental actions. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurred that impacted our employees&#8217; ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working may also result in increased consumer privacy, data security, and fraud risks, and our understanding of applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the latest guidance from regulatory authorities in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, may be subject to legal or regulatory challenge, particularly as regulatory guidance evolves in response to future developments.  More generally, the COVID-19 pandemic has and is expected to continue to adversely affect economies and financial markets globally, leading to a continued economic downturn, which may decrease technology spending generally and could adversely affect demand for our platforms and services. It is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.  Moreover, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section, including but not limited to, those related to our ability to increase sales to existing and new customers, continue to perform on existing contracts,  Table of contents  develop and deploy new technologies, expand our marketing capabilities and sales organization, generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness, and comply with the covenants in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.  If the market for our platforms and services develops more slowly than we expect, our growth may slow or stall, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.  The market for our platforms is rapidly evolving. Our future success will depend in large part on the growth and expansion of this market, which is difficult to predict and relies on a number of factors, including customer adoption, customer demand, changing customer needs, the entry of competitive products, the success of existing competitive products, potential customers&#8217; willingness to adopt an alternative approach to data collection, storage, and processing and their willingness to invest in new software after significant prior investments in legacy data collection, storage, and processing software. The estimates and assumptions that are used to calculate our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no guarantee that any particular number or percentage of the organizations covered by our market opportunity estimates will pay for our platforms and services at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecasts, our business could fail to grow at the levels we expect or at all for a variety of reasons outside our control, including competition in our industry. Further, if we or other data management and analytics providers experience security breaches or incidents, loss, corruption, or unavailability of or unauthorized access to customer data, disruptions in delivery, or other problems, this market as a whole, including our platforms, may be negatively affected. If software for the challenges that we address does not achieve widespread adoption, or there is a reduction in demand caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions (including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and related economic sanctions, or inflation), security or privacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending, or otherwise, or, alternatively, if the market develops but we are unable to continue to penetrate it due to the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our platforms, or other factors, it could result in decreased revenue and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.  We will face risks associated with the growth of our business in new commercial markets and with new customer verticals, and we may neither be able to continue our organic growth nor have the necessary resources to dedicate to the overall growth of our business.  We plan to expand our operations in new commercial markets, including those where we may have limited operating experience, and may be subject to increased business, technology and economic risks that could affect our financial results. In recent periods, we have increased our focus on commercial customers. In the future, we may increasingly focus on such customers, including in the banking, financial services, healthcare, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, telecommunication, automotive, airlines and aerospace, consumer packaged goods, insurance, retail, transportation, shipping and logistics, energy, and other emerging industries. Entering new verticals and expanding in the verticals in which we are already operating will continue to require significant resources and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful or beneficial to us. Historically, sales to new customers have often led to additional sales to the same customers or similarly situated customers. As we expand into and within new and emerging markets and heavily regulated industry verticals, we will likely face additional regulatory scrutiny, risks, and burdens from the governments and agencies which regulate those markets and industries. While this approach to expansion within new commercial markets and verticals has proven successful in the past, it is uncertain we will achieve the same penetration and organic growth in the future and our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of
