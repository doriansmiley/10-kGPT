typically provide short-term pilot deployments of our platforms at no or low cost initially. We sometimes spend substantial time, effort, and money in our sales efforts without producing any sales. The success of the investments that we make in the earlier stages of our sales cycle depends on factors such as our ability to identify potential customers for which our platforms have an opportunity to add significant value to the customer&#8217;s organization, our ability to identify and agree with the potential customer on an appropriate pilot deployment to demonstrate the value of our platforms, and whether we successfully execute on such pilot deployment. Even if the pilot deployment is successful, we or the customer could choose not to enter into a larger contract for a variety of reasons. For example, product purchases by large enterprises and government entities are frequently subject to budget constraints, leadership changes, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing, and other delays, any of which could significantly delay or entirely prevent our realization of sales. Finally, large enterprises and government entities typically (i) have longer implementation cycles, (ii) require greater product functionality and scalability and a broader range of services, including design services, (iii) demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks, (iv) sometimes require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition, (v) typically have more complex IT and data environments, and (vi) expect greater payment flexibility from vendors. Customers, and sometimes we, may also engage third parties to be the users of our platforms, which may result in contractual complexities and risks, require additional investment of time and human resources to train the third parties and allow third parties (who may be building competitive projects or engaging in other competitive activities) to influence our customers&#8217; perception of our platforms. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers. If sales expected from a large customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.  In addition, part of our growth strategy involves supporting a broader set of potential customers. Sales to such customers involve risks that vary from those present with sales to large or otherwise established organizations, due to their limited operating history, limited resources for adopting new technologies, and uncertain resources for future operations, among other things. Accordingly, we will continue to refine our business strategy and pricing structures to attract and retain such customers, as well as existing and larger customers across the potential customer base. There is no guarantee that our existing or proposed business strategies, including subscription-based or usage-based pricing structures, will achieve broad adoption by current or prospective customers or be appropriately structured to attract and retain other potential customers across the customer base.  If we are not successful in executing our sales strategy, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects could be adversely affected.  The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and related challenging macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business and operations, and the duration and extent to which these factors may impact our future business, financial condition, and results of operations remain uncertain.  While the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict have provided certain new opportunities for our business to expand, they have also created many negative headwinds that present risks to our business and results of operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and related challenging macroeconomic conditions have generally disrupted the operations of our customers and prospective customers, and may continue to disrupt their operations, including as a result of widespread supply chain disruptions, increases in the prices of many goods and services, uncertainty in the financial markets or financial services sector, or other harm to their business and financial results. Challenging macroeconomic conditions could decrease information technology budgets for our customers and prospective customers; adversely affect demand for our platform and services; cause one or more of our customers or partners to file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business; cause one or more of our customers to fail to renew, terminate, or seek to renegotiate their contracts with us; cause delayed purchasing decisions, longer sales cycles, extended or alternative payment terms or delayed payments; impact our ability to attract new customers on similar contractual terms or at all, or retain and expand our relationships with existing customers; and result in postponed or canceled projects, all of which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including sales and cash flows. For example, some of our early-stage Investee (as defined below) customers recently filed for bankruptcy and we may not realize the full value of our commercial contracts with such customers as a result. It is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia-Ukraine conflict, and related challenging macroeconomic conditions will have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. We cannot guarantee that it will not be materially negative.  In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related work and travel restrictions, many of our field sales, operations and maintenance, and professional services activities were conducted remotely, and a majority of our workforce worked remotely. We have reopened our offices and have allowed business travel to resume, but some of our employees will continue to work remotely. We have a limited history of operating with a hybrid workforce. There is no guarantee that we will realize any anticipated benefits to our business from this model, including cost savings, operational efficiencies, or productivity. It is also possible that remote work arrangements may have a negative impact on our operations; the execution of our business plans; our ability to recruit, train, manage, and retain employees; our ability to maintain and strengthen our company culture; the productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business; and on third-party  service providers who perform critical services for us, or otherwise cause operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurred that impacted our employees&#8217; ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working may also result in increased consumer privacy, data security, and fraud risks, and our understanding of applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the latest guidance from regulatory authorities may be subject to legal or regulatory challenge, particularly as regulatory guidance evolves in response to future developments. If we are unable to successfully address the foregoing risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business and operations could be adversely affected.  Moreover, to the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and related challenging macroeconomic conditions adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, these events, alone or in combination, may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section, including but not limited to, those related to maintaining company culture, our ability to increase sales to existing and new customers, continue to perform on existing contracts, develop and deploy new technologies, expand our marketing capabilities and sales organization, and generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness, volatility in the trading price of our Class A common stock, and our ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.  If the market for our platforms and services develops more slowly than we expect, our growth may slow or stall, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.  The market for our platforms is rapidly evolving. Our future success will depend in large part on the growth and expansion of this market, which is difficult to predict and relies on a number of factors, including customer adoption, customer demand, changing customer needs, the entry of competitive products, the success of existing competitive products, potential customers&#8217; willingness to adopt an alternative approach to data collection, storage, and processing and their willingness to invest in new software after significant prior investments in legacy data collection, storage, and processing software. The estimates and assumptions that are used to calculate our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no guarantee that any particular number or percentage of the organizations covered by our market opportunity estimates will pay for our platforms and services at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecasts, our business could fail to grow at the levels we expect or at all for a variety of reasons outside our control, including competition in our industry. Further, if we or other data management and analytics providers experience security breaches or incidents, loss, corruption, or unavailability of or unauthorized access to customer data, disruptions in delivery, or other problems, this market as a whole, including our platforms, may be negatively
