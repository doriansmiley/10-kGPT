The information provided indicates a high level of market risk exposure to the business due to fluctuations in the value of investments, interest rates, foreign exchange, and inflation. The company had net unrealized losses of $192.8 million related to marketable securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Investing in early- or growth-stage companies carries inherent risks and the company may face a decline in financial condition, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of their investments. Additionally, the company may face volatility in their condensed consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market prices, and as such gains and losses are realized. Foreign currency exchange rates may cause the company to recognize transaction gains and losses in their statement of operations, which may impact their results of current and future operations and cash flows. Furthermore, inflation risk is present and could negatively impact the business, financial condition, or results of operations if costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures and the company cannot offset such higher costs through price increases. The level of risk exposure presented in this information could concern potential investors, and the score is below average.</body></html>
