Summary:
Investing in the company's Class A common stock poses a high degree of risk. The company has incurred losses each year and may not become profitable in the future. The company's revenue growth rate may decline, and sustaining revenue growth may be challenging due to increased competition, slowing demand for the platforms, and maturation of the business. The company's sales efforts are costly, and the sales cycle is often long and unpredictable, which may fluctuate the company's results of operations. The company is subject to several risks, including dependence on a limited number of customers, fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality, complex platforms and implementation process, failure to develop and deploy new technologies, intense competition, government regulations, intellectual property rights claims, bugs in the platforms, among others. The COVID-19 pandemic is also seen as a significant risk. The company may not realize a return on strategic investments or maintain its culture as the company grows. The company's multi-class structure of common stock concentrates voting power with certain stockholders, which could be perceived as a risk.</body></html>
