The information provided in the extracted page from the 10-Q and 10-K filings suggests that the company's business is subject to risks due to a significant portion of its revenue coming from existing customers. The company's sales efforts require extensive resources and investments, and there is no assurance that they will be successful in making a sale to a potential customer. The company's existing customers account for a substantial portion of its revenue, and if they do not make subsequent purchases or renew their contracts, the company's revenue could decline, adversely impacting its results of operations. 

Moreover, many of the customer contracts are short-term, and customers may terminate or renegotiate their agreements, which could further impact the company's business and results of operations. The company's ability to realize the full deal value of its customer contracts is subject to various contingencies, which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The company's quarterly results of operations and key business measures are likely to fluctuate significantly, making it challenging to predict its future results. 

Overall, the information suggests that the company's business is subject to numerous risks, which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. Therefore, the rating for this information is negative, and the score is below average.</body></html>
