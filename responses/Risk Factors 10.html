The extracted text reveals several risks that could negatively impact the financial position of the company, its results of operations, and earnings per share. The potential acquisition may limit other potential uses of the company's cash and limit the ability to conduct business. The use of debt financing may also negatively impact the company's ability to conduct business since it may subject them to material restrictions and financial maintenance covenants. Additionally, new investments may not be profitable, leading to losses related to these marketable securities. The company's dependence on third-party products and components, coupled with the possibility of cybersecurity attacks, may disrupt operations and cause financial losses. Laws governing security breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential information, and intellectual property also pose a risk. If such risks materialize, they could lead to a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the company.</body></html>
