The information provided in the filing raises concerns regarding the company's cybersecurity measures and its dependence on third-party providers, such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft, to host or operate some of its key technology platform features. A breach in security or other cybersecurity attacks could lead to direct or indirect liabilities, costs, or damages, termination of contracts, loss of reputation, and reduction in future prospects. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) also presents risks and challenges that could affect the company's development and use of its business. Disruptions, failures, data loss, outages, or other performance problems with its infrastructure or cloud-based offerings could adversely affect its business, and its disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all situations. Lastly, the systems and third-party systems that the company relies on are vulnerable to damage or interruption from catastrophic occurrences, which could result in interruptions, performance problems, or failure of its infrastructure, technology, or platforms, leading to a negative impact on its business.</body></html>
