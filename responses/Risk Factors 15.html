The information presented in this page extracted from the filing portrays a negative impact on the company to a potential investor. The company faces a significant compliance challenge due to privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations around the world, which may require substantial costs and expenses to maintain compliance. The complexity of laws and regulations may also result in fines, lawsuits, and other claims. Additionally, the company's non-U.S. sales and operations pose additional risks and challenges, such as increased costs and time associated with compliance, longer payment cycles, difficulties in enforcing contracts, and the need to adapt platforms for non-U.S. customers. These challenges may limit the use and adoption of the company's platforms and services and increase its operating costs. As a result, the score is below average based on the performance of an average high-growth company.</body></html>
