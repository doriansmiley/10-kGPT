The information provided in the extracted page from the filing indicates multiple risks that may negatively impact the business, financial condition, and growth prospects of the company. The risks include compliance with foreign laws and regulations, new and different sources of competition, heightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies, volatility in non-U.S. political and economic environments, weaker protection of intellectual property rights in some regions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, communication and integration problems, difficulties in repatriating or transferring funds, potentially adverse tax consequences, unfamiliarity with local laws and practices, business and operations interruptions, restrictions on the transfer of data, and potential involvement in legal proceedings. These risks may increase costs, decrease revenue, damage the reputation, reduce sales, or result in monetary damages, litigation or penalties. The combination of the risks, their potential impact, and the uncertainty of their occurrence leads to a negative outlook for the potential investor, with a score below average based on the performance of a high-growth company.</body></html>
