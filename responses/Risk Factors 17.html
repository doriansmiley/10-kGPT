The information presented in this filing poses significant risks for potential investors. The company operates and sells platforms and services around the world, and therefore subject to various anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations in different jurisdictions. There is a heightened risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of their employees or third-party business partners, representatives, and agents that could be in violation of various laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;) and the U.K. Bribery Act. The company's exposure for violating these laws increases as its non-U.S. presence expands and as it increases sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of anti-corruption laws may result in whistleblower complaints, investigations, loss of export privileges, significant legal fees, and severe criminal or civil sanctions, including suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting. Additionally, the company's offerings are subject to U.S. export controls, and compliance with the Export Administration Regulations (&#8220;EAR&#8221;) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (&#8220;ITAR&#8221;) regarding the export of their products may create delays in the introduction of products in non-U.S. markets and prevent the export of products to some countries altogether. The company may also be adversely affected by reputational harm and other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties, in the event of violations or apparent violations of trade control requirements. Overall, these risks pose a significant threat to any potential investor's investment in the company, resulting in a below-average score.</body></html>
