The information provided in the extracted page suggests that the company's business and financial performance may be negatively impacted due to various factors. The changes in government attitude towards the products offered by the company, appeals and disputes relating to government procurements, adoption of new laws or regulations, budgetary constraints, influence by third parties, changes in social attitudes towards security or data privacy issues, potential delays or changes in the government appropriations or procurement processes, and increased or unexpected costs are some of the factors that could affect the company's business operations. Additionally, the company derives a portion of its revenue from programs with governments and government agencies that are subject to security restrictions, which may limit investor insight into portions of the business.

Furthermore, the company's contracts with government agencies contain provisions with additional rights and remedies favorable to the customers, which are not typically found in commercial contracts. The customers have the option to terminate existing contracts for convenience with short notice, reduce orders under or modify contracts, demand a refund or terminate a contract for default if the company provided inaccurate or incomplete data during the contract negotiation process, among others. If a customer were to unexpectedly terminate, cancel, or decline to exercise an option to renew with respect to one or more of the company's significant contracts, or if a government were to suspend or debar the company from doing business with such government, the company's financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed.

In addition, failure to comply with laws, regulations, or contractual provisions applicable to the business could cause the company to lose government customers or the ability to contract with the U.S. and other governments, leading to penalties, litigation, or suspension or debarment from government contracting. The risks associated with non-compliance may prove costly to the business financially, divert management time, or limit the company's ability to continue selling its platforms and services to government customers.

Overall, the information provided in the extracted page suggests a negative outlook for a perspective investor due to the risks associated with the government contracts and the potential for costly legal proceedings. Therefore, the score for the information provided is below average for an average high growth company.</body></html>
