The information provided in the extracted page suggests that there are several risks and challenges that could impact the financial performance of the company. The evolving government procurement policies and increased emphasis on cost over performance, together with a decline in the U.S. and other government budgets, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, or delays in contract awards are among the most significant challenges. Other risks include increased competition, bid protests, and potential litigation with the U.S. government, which could result in significant expenses, contract modifications, or even the loss of the contract award. The public trading price of the Class A common stock is also volatile and may decline regardless of the company's operating performance. Overall, the score is low as the risks mentioned could negatively impact the company's financial performance and limit the growth prospects.</body></html>
