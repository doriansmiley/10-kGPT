The filing contains several provisions in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that may discourage a change in control of the company. These provisions, along with the concentration of voting power with the Founders and their affiliates, may make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause the company to take other corporate actions desired by them, which could limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of Class A common stock. 

Additionally, the trading market for Class A common stock may be affected by inaccurate or unfavorable research by securities or industry analysts, and the company's future status as a controlled company would reduce independent directors' ability to influence business policies and corporate matters.
