The information provided in the extract highlights the concentration of control among our Founders and their affiliates. This control includes a significant portion of the voting power of our capital stock, which may limit the ability of stockholders to influence important decisions such as the election of directors, compensation matters, or major transactions requiring stockholder approval. The Founders and their affiliates hold a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock and are party to voting trust and voting agreements which concentrate voting power in the hands of the Founders. This structure may deprive other shareholders of the opportunity to sell their shares at a premium or to replace directors and management. The information also highlights that the Founders and their affiliates could acquire additional shares, which would increase their voting power even more. Therefore, the overall impact of this information may be seen as negative by a potential investor. The score reflects the below-average potential of the company due to the concentration of control, which may not align with the interests of other stockholders.</body></html>
