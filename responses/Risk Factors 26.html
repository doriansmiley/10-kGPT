The information provided in the filing could be perceived negatively by a potential investor. The company highlights the risks associated with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules and regulations of the NYSE. The costs associated with compliance with these regulations are expected to be high and may divert management's attention from the day-to-day operations of the company. Additionally, limited experience of some members of the management team and limited accounting and financial reporting personnel may impact the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The company may also face higher expenses as a public company, and changing laws and regulations are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs. The exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could also negatively impact the company's financial condition and results of operations. Overall, these concerns could potentially deter potential investors from investing in the company.</body></html>
