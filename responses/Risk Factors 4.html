The information provided in the excerpt is negative for potential investors as it highlights the challenges that the company faces in attracting, training and retaining skilled personnel, specifically in major U.S. markets and international markets where they have expanded or will expand their non-U.S. operations. Additionally, the company depends on the quality of its services, and its inability to offer high-quality services could have a material adverse effect on its sales and results of operations. It may be challenging for the company to respond quickly enough to short-term increases in customer demand without negatively affecting its business and results of operations. The score based on the performance of an average high growth company is below average.</body></html>
