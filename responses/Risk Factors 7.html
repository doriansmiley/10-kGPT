Summary: The company has taken a stance against working with the Chinese communist party and does not host their platform in China, which limits growth prospects. The company also faces risks and challenges regarding joint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, and strategic alliances. These arrangements require significant investments of time and resources, and there is no guarantee of success.
