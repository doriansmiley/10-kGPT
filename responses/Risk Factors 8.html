The information provided in the filing indicates some risks that potential investors may need to consider. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the company's operations, creating negative headwinds that present risks to its business and results of operations. The pandemic has disrupted the operations of the company's customers and prospective customers, including those in the technology industry, which could result in a reduction to IT budgets, longer sales cycles, and delayed payments. Additionally, the company's field sales and professional services activities are still being conducted remotely, resulting in a decrease in travel and office expenditure. However, the increase in remote working could result in increased consumer privacy, data security, and fraud risks, and operational failures due to changes in the company's normal business practices due to the pandemic. 

Furthermore, the market for the company's platforms is rapidly evolving and relies on a number of factors. There is no guarantee that any particular number or percentage of organizations will pay for the company's platforms and services, generate revenue for the company, or that the market will meet growth forecasts. Even if the market meets growth forecasts, competition from other providers, security breaches or incidents, and other factors could affect the market, including the demand for the company's platforms.

Finally, the company faces risks associated with the growth of its business in new commercial markets and with new customer verticals, and it may not have the necessary resources to dedicate to the overall growth of its business. The company plans to expand into new commercial markets, including those where it may have limited operating experience, and may face additional regulatory scrutiny, risks, and burdens from the governments and agencies which regulate those markets and industries.

Overall, the risks involved in the company's operations and expansion plans may deter potential investors, resulting in a below-average score.</body></html>
