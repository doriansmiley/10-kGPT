Score: Average

Explanation: The fact that there are no changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure is a positive sign indicating that the financial statements in the filing are reliable and accurate. This information would not negatively impact a potential investor's decision to invest in the company. However, this is a common disclosure in 10-Q and 10-K filings and would not necessarily be considered a standout positive. Therefore, the score is average based on the performance of an average high growth company.</body></html>
