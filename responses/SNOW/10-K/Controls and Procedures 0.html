The filing indicates that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2023, and that there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting. The internal control over financial reporting was also found to be effective as of January 31, 2023, based on an assessment conducted by management and audited by an independent registered public accounting firm. However, there are inherent limitations in even well-designed control systems, and management acknowledges that misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Overall, the information presented in the filing is neutral with an average score.</body></html>
