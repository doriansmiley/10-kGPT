The cost of professional services and other revenue increased significantly due to increased headcount, overhead costs, and stock-based compensation related to equity awards granted to existing and new employees. Although professional services and other gross margin improved, it is insignificant and does not offer any real advantage. 

Sales and marketing expenses have increased considerably due to the rise in personnel-related costs, commission expenses, advertising costs, and other expenses related to sales and marketing events. The increase in costs and expenses associated with sales and marketing events, and user conferences may contribute to sales growth, but it also increases travel-related expenses. 

Research and development expenses have increased considerably due to an increase in personnel-related costs, headcount, and stock-based compensation. The increase in third-party cloud infrastructure expenses increases the costs of developing the platform. 

General and administrative expenses have increased, and the increase is mainly due to more outside services, legal fees related to acquisition, unallocated lease costs, increased insurance expenses, and other corporate expenses. 

Although interest income has increased, there has been a decrease in other income (expense), net, which is significant. There has been an increase in provisions for (benefit from) income taxes, which may have been due to fluctuations in earnings in countries with higher statutory rates. 

While the company has financing from proceeds received from sales of equity securities and payments received from customers, the expenses incurred for personnel, third-party cloud infrastructure, and overhead costs may offset earnings and may result in an unfavorable financial position.</body></html>
