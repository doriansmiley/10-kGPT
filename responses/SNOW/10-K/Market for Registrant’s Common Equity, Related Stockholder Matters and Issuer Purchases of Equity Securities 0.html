Explanation: 

The information provided in this section indicates a positive status for the company to a perspective investor. The company's Class A common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, allowing investors to trade in public. Although the number of stockholders may seem small, it is not unusual for a young and growing high-growth company. However, the absence of dividends may be perceived as a negative factor for some investors who might prefer cashflows in the near future. The information about using remaining earnings for business expansion could indicate growth potential for a long-term investment. The securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans that are deferred to the definitive Proxy Statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting of stockholders gives an investor a chance to review the performance of the plan before investment decisions. Also, the company's acquisition of Streamlit will help to broaden its market base. The company's expenses from the IPO and the private placements have been indicated, giving investors an overview and it's good to note that no issuer purchases of equity securities were made, which means that the company did not repurchase its own shares. Finally, the stock performance graph indicates a cumulative total return to stockholders between September 16, 2020, and January 31, 2023, in comparison to the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Information Technology Index, which might reassure some investors about the company's past performance.</body></html>
