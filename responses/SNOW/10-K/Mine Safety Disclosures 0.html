Explanation: 
The absence of mine safety disclosures is neither positive nor negative for a perspective investor. It does not indicate any potential risks or benefits related to the company's financial performance. Therefore, the rating is neutral. Since this information is unrelated to financial performance, it has no effect on score. Therefore, the score remains at the average level for an average high growth company.</body></html>
