The extracted information from the 10-Q and 10-K filings states that there is no other information provided under ITEM 9B. As a result, there is nothing to evaluate in terms of positive or negative impact on a potential investor. Therefore, the rating is neutral, meaning it will not affect the investor's decision to invest, and the score is average since it is consistent with the performance of an average high-growth company.</body></html>
