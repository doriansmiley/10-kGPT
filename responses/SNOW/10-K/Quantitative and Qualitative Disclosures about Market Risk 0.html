The information provided in the SEC filing indicates that there are three significant market risks that could impact the company's financial performance: interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, and market-related risks associated with strategic investments. 

First, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $26.0 million or an increase of $25.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, respectively. This sensitivity analysis shows that the company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments are exposed to interest rate risk, which could impact the overall value of these investments. 

Secondly, the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as its operating expenses are denominated in different currencies. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates would have resulted in a theoretical increase or decrease in operating loss of approximately $32 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. This risk could expand over time as the company increases its sales in international currencies. 

Finally, the company's strategic investments are subject to market-related risks, including volatility in the public and private markets that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of the investments. The table presented in the filing shows that the company's non-marketable equity securities and marketable equity securities decreased from $204.5 million as of January 31, 2022, to $196.4 million as of January 31, 2023. 

Overall, the information provided suggests that the company is exposed to market risks that could impact its financial performance. However, compared to an average high-growth company, these risks are not exceptionally high, leading to a below-average score.</body></html>
