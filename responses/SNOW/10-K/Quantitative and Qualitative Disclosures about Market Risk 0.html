The disclosure of the interest rate risk shows that a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $26.0 million or an increase of $25.9 million, respectively, in the market value of the company's cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. This indicates that the company's investments are sensitive to fluctuating interest rates which can pose a risk to investors. The disclosure of foreign currency risk includes hedging activities to reduce but not eliminate its impact, and a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a theoretical increase or decrease in operating loss of approximately $32 million. The disclosure of the market risk highlights that the company's strategic investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks which could substantially reduce the carrying value of the investments, risking the company's financial results. Overall, the risk factors disclosed in the filing indicate a below-average score for a high growth company, which could negatively impact the returns for potential investors.</body></html>
