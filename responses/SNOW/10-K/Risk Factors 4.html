The information provided in this section of the filing highlights significant risks associated with the company's growth strategy, particularly through acquisitions and partnerships. The company acknowledges that such activities could divert management's attention, disrupt their business, and adversely affect financial performance. Additionally, seasonality in sales could cause fluctuations in performance obligations. 

Moreover, the company's business with government entities and heavily regulated organizations poses a variety of risks including difficulties in the procurement process, delays, budgetary constraints, and compliance with complex regulations and contractual provisions. The lengthy and uncertain sales cycles in the government sector make it difficult for the company to predict the timing of entering into customer agreements, and they are also subject to contract terminations and investigations for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which could lead to significant penalties and reputational harm. 

Overall, these risks could adversely affect the company's financial condition and results of operations.</body></html>
