The information provided in the filings suggests that the Company faces significant risks related to currency fluctuations, intellectual property, and use of open-source software. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect its operations, results, and cash flows. The intellectual property laws of foreign countries may not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary information and assets as those of the United States, and the Company may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending its intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad. Litigation may be necessary to enforce its intellectual property or proprietary rights, protect its trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. The use of open source software may subject the Company to legal expenses, damages, or costly remediation or disruption to its business. These risks could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations and, therefore, appear negative to a potential investor, with a score below average.</body></html>
