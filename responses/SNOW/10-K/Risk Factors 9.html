Analysis:
- The company highlights multiple factors that may lead to an increase in effective tax rate that could adversely affect the results of operations. (Negative)
- The market price of the company's common stock is highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to various factors beyond the control of the company. (Negative)
- The company expects to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders, which could cause the per-share value of common stock to decline. (Negative)
- The existence of the company's stock repurchase program could cause the stock price to be higher than it otherwise would be and could potentially reduce market liquidity for the stock. (Negative)
- The company does not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, and therefore, the ability of the holders of common stock to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of common stock. (Negative)
- The company incurs significant costs operating as a public company and management is required to devote substantial time to compliance with public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices. Laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, resulting in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.
