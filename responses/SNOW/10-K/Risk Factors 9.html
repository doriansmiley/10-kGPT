The information provided in this page from the filing suggests various risks associated with investing in the company. One major concern is the potential increase in the effective tax rate due to several factors, including changes in tax laws, jurisdictions, and tax audits, which could adversely affect the company's operations. The volatility in the stock price of the company is another concern for prospective investors, as it may fluctuate significantly due to various factors beyond the company's control, including fluctuations in financial performance, changes in laws or regulations, and market conditions.

Moreover, stock dilution may negatively impact the per-share value of the company's common stock, as it intends to issue additional capital stock in the future and expects to grant equity awards to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants under its equity incentive plans. Furthermore, the absence of any cash dividends in the foreseeable future may depend on appreciation in the price of the company's common stock, which may never occur. The significant costs incurred in operating as a public company and complying with public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices are also a potential risk for investors as they result in higher expenses and and management's attention being diverted from revenue-generating activities.

Overall, while some of these risks are typical of high-growth companies, they may be concerning to potential investors, and hence the score is rated as average.</body></html>
