Explanation:

The fact that there are no unresolved staff comments in the 10-Q or 10-K filing is a positive signal for potential investors. Unresolved staff comments indicate that the company has pending issues or concerns raised by the SEC staff that could potentially impact the financial statements or disclosures. The absence of such comments means that the SEC has no further concerns regarding the company's financial reporting, which is a positive sign of compliance and transparency. Therefore, this item receives a positive rating with an average score since it does not provide any additional information about the company's financial performance or growth potential.</body></html>
