 ITEM 1. BUSINESS  We believe in a data connected world where organizations have seamless access to explore, share, and unlock the value of data. To realize this vision, we deliver the Data Cloud, a network where Snowflake customers, partners, developers, data providers, and data consumers can break down data silos and derive value from rapidly growing data sets in secure, governed, and compliant ways.  Our platform is the innovative technology that powers the Data Cloud, enabling customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful business insights, build data applications, and share data and data products. We provide our platform through a customer-centric, consumption-based business model, only charging customers for the resources they use.  Snowflake solves the decades-old problem of data silos and data governance. Leveraging the elasticity and performance of the public cloud, our platform enables customers to unify and query data to support a wide variety of use cases. It also provides frictionless and governed data access so users can securely share data inside and outside of their organizations, generally without copying or moving the underlying data. As a result, customers can blend existing data with new data for broader context, augment data science efforts, and create new monetization streams. Delivered as a service, our platform requires near-zero maintenance, enabling customers to focus on deriving value from their data rather than managing infrastructure.  Our cloud-native architecture consists of three independently scalable but logically integrated layers across compute, storage, and cloud services. The compute layer provides dedicated resources to enable users to simultaneously access common data sets for many use cases with minimal latency. The storage layer ingests massive amounts and varieties of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data to create a unified data record. The cloud services layer intelligently optimizes each use case&#8217;s performance requirements with no administration. This architecture is built on three major public clouds across 38 regional deployments around the world. These deployments are generally interconnected to deliver the Data Cloud, enabling a consistent, global user experience.  Our platform supports a wide range of workloads that enable our customers&#8217; most important business objectives, including data warehousing, data lakes, and Unistore, as well as collaboration, data engineering, cybersecurity, data science and machine learning, and application development. From January 1, 2023 to January 31, 2023, we processed an average of approximately 2.6 billion daily queries across all our customer accounts, up from an average of approximately 1.5 billion daily queries during the corresponding month of the prior fiscal year. We are committed to expanding our platform&#8217;s use cases and supporting developers in building their applications and businesses. In 2021, we launched Snowpark for Java to allow developers to build in the language of their choice, and in 2022 we added support for Python. We continue to invest in our Powered by Snowflake program to help companies build, operate, and market applications in the Data Cloud by supporting developers across all stages of the application journey. As of January 31, 2023, we had over 820 Powered by Snowflake registrants. Powered by Snowflake partners have access to go-to-market, customer support, and engineering expertise.  We have an industry-vertical focus, which allows us to go to market with tailored business solutions. For example, we have launched the Telecom Data Cloud, the Financial Services Data Cloud, the Media Data Cloud, the Healthcare and Life Sciences Data Cloud, and the Retail Data Cloud. Each of these brings together Snowflake&#8217;s platform capabilities with industry-specific partner solutions and datasets to drive business growth and deliver improved experiences and insights.  Our business benefits from powerful network effects. The Data Cloud will continue to grow as organizations move their siloed data from cloud-based repositories and on-premises data centers to the Data Cloud. The more customers adopt our platform, the more data can be exchanged with other Snowflake customers, partners, data providers, and data consumers, enhancing the value of our platform for all users. We believe this network effect will help us drive our vision of the Data Cloud.  Ta ble of Contents  Our platform is used globally by organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries. As of January 31, 2023, we had 7,828 total customers, increasing from 5,967 customers as of January 31, 2022. As of January 31, 2023, our customers included 573 of the Forbes Global 2000, based on the 2022 Forbes Global 2000 list, and those customers contributed approximately 41% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is subject to adjustments for annual updates to the Global 2000 list by Forbes, as well as acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity with respect to such customers, and we present our Forbes Global 2000 customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments. As our customers experience the benefits of our platform, they typically expand their usage significantly, as evidenced by our net revenue retention rate, which was 158% as of January 31, 2023. The number of customers that contributed more than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue increased from 184 to 330 as of January 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively.  We have achieved significant growth in recent periods. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, our revenue was $2.1 billion, $1.2 billion, and $592.0 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 69% and 106%, respectively. Our net loss was $797.5 million, $679.9 million, and $539.1 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.  The Rise of the Data Cloud  Data exists everywhere, but is often held hostage in silos by machines, applications, networks, and clouds. In order to access the value of this data, organizations are undergoing massive digital transformation initiatives, and data is driving operations for many modern enterprises. In an effort to mobilize data, companies have invested billions of dollars in disparate on-premises systems, infrastructure clouds, and application clouds. Yet, there are a myriad of challenges associated with legacy data solutions and the data silo problem persists.  We believe the Data Cloud can enable a world without data silos, allowing organizations to effortlessly discover, access, derive insights from, and share data from a variety of sources. Customers can share and provide access to each other&#8217;s data or data products, augment data science and machine learning algorithms with more data sets, connect global supply chains through data hubs, build data products, and create new monetization channels by connecting data providers and consumers. As the Data Cloud grows through broad adoption and increasing usage, there are enhanced benefits from greater data availability. Moving forward, we are continuing to foster these benefits through industry-specific Data Clouds and the Powered by Snowflake program.
