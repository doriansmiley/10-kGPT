For more information, including a definition of non-GAAP free cash flow and a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), see the section titled &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221;  Human Capital Resources  General  As of January 31, 2023, we had 5,884 employees operating across 33 countries.
