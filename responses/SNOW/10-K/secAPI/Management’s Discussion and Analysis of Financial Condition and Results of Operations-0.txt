We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our supplemental non-GAAP information and the GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliation included in the section titled &#8220;Key Business Metrics&#8212;Free Cash Flow,&#8221; to more fully understand our business.  Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to &#8220;Snowflake,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or similar terms refer to Snowflake Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 can be found in &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2022.  Overview  We believe in a data connected world where organizations have seamless access to explore, share, and unlock the value of data. To realize this vision, we deliver the Data Cloud, a network where Snowflake customers, partners, developers, data providers, and data consumers can break down data silos and derive value from rapidly growing data sets in secure, governed, and compliant ways.  Our platform is the innovative technology that powers the Data Cloud, enabling customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful business insights, build data applications, and share data and data products. We provide our platform through a customer-centric, consumption-based business model, only charging customers for the resources they use.  Our cloud-native architecture consists of three independently scalable but logically integrated layers across compute, storage, and cloud services. The compute layer provides dedicated resources to enable users to simultaneously access common data sets for many use cases with minimal latency. The storage layer ingests massive amounts and varieties of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data to create a unified data record. The cloud services layer intelligently optimizes each use case&#8217;s performance requirements with no administration. This architecture is built on three major public clouds across 38 regional deployments around the world. These deployments are generally interconnected to deliver the Data Cloud, enabling a consistent, global user experience.  We generate the substantial majority of our revenue from fees charged to our customers based on the compute, storage, and data transfer resources consumed on our platform as a single, integrated offering. For compute resources, consumption fees are based on the type of compute resource used and the duration of use or, for some features, the volume of data processed. For storage resources, consumption fees are based on the average terabytes per month of all of the customer&#8217;s data stored in our platform. For data transfer resources, consumption fees are based on terabytes of data transferred, the public cloud provider used, and the region to and from which the transfer is executed.  Ta ble of Contents  Our customers typically enter into capacity arrangements with a term of one to four years, or consume our platform under on-demand arrangements in which we charge for use of our platform monthly in arrears. Consumption for most customers accelerates from the beginning of their usage to the end of their contract terms and often exceeds their initial capacity commitment amounts. When this occurs, our customers have the option to amend their existing agreement with us to purchase additional capacity or request early renewals. When a customer&#8217;s consumption during the contract term does not exceed its capacity commitment amount, it may have the option to roll over any unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity. For these reasons, we believe our deferred revenue is not a meaningful indicator of future revenue that will be recognized in any given time period.  Our go-to-market strategy is focused on acquiring new customers and driving continued use of our platform for existing customers. We primarily focus our selling efforts on large organizations and primarily sell our platform through a direct sales force, which targets technical and business leaders who are adopting a cloud strategy and leveraging data to improve their business performance. Our sales force is comprised of sales development, inside sales, and field sales personnel and is segmented by the industry, size, and region of prospective customers. Once our platform has been adopted, we focus on increasing the migration of additional customer workloads to our platform to drive increased consumption, as evidenced by our net revenue retention rate of 158% and 177% as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See the section titled &#8220;Key Business Metrics&#8221; for a definition of net revenue retention rate.  Our platform is used globally by organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries. As of January 31, 2023, we had 7,828 total customers, increasing from 5,967 customers as of January 31, 2022. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our total customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments. Our platform has been adopted by many of the world&#8217;s largest organizations that view Snowflake as a key strategic partner in their cloud and data transformation initiatives. As of January 31, 2023, our customers included 573 of the Forbes Global 2000, based on the 2022 Forbes Global 2000 list, and those customers contributed approximately 41% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is subject to adjustments for annual updates to the Global 2000 list by Forbes, as well as acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity with respect to such customers, and we present our Forbes Global 2000 customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments.  Fiscal Year  Our fiscal year ends on January 31. For example, references to fiscal 2023 refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.  Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions  Our business and financial condition have been, and may continue to be, impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions, including higher inflation, higher interest rates, and fluctuations or volatility in capital markets or foreign currency exchange rates, which are causing customers to optimize consumption, rationalize budgets, and prioritize cash flow management (including through shortened contract duration). We are continuing to monitor the actual and potential effects of general macroeconomic conditions across our business. For additional details, see the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221;  Stock Repurchase Program  In February 2023, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock. Repurchases may be effected, from time to time, either on the open market (including via pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, or through other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The program is funded using our working capital and will expire in March 2025.  The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.  Ta ble of Contents  Business Combinations  On March 31, 2022, we acquired all outstanding stock of Streamlit, Inc. (Streamlit), a privately-held company which provides an open-source framework for creating and deploying data applications. The acquisition date fair value of the purchase consideration was $650.8 million, which was comprised of $211.8 million in cash and 1.9 million shares of our common stock valued at $438.9 million as of the acquisition date. In addition, we issued to Streamlit&#8217;s three founders a total of 0.4 million shares of our common stock in exchange for a portion of their Streamlit stock. These shares are subject to vesting agreements pursuant to which the shares will vest over three years, subject to each founder&#8217;s continued employment with us. The $93.7 million fair value of these shares are accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation over the requisite service period of three years.
