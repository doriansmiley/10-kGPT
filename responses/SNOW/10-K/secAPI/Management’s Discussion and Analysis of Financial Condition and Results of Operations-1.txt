On September 23, 2022, we acquired all outstanding stock of Applica Sp. z.o.o. (Applica), a privately-held company which provides an artificial intelligence platform for document understanding, for $174.7 million in cash.  The results of operations of these business combinations have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. See Note 7, &#8220;Business Combinations,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding these business combinations.  Key Factors Affecting Our Performance  Adoption of our Platform and Expansion of the Data Cloud  Our future success depends in large part on the market adoption of our platform. While we see growing demand for our platform, particularly from large enterprises, many of these organizations have invested substantial technical, financial, and personnel resources in their legacy database products or big data offerings, despite their inherent limitations. While this makes it difficult to predict customer adoption rates and future demand, we believe that the benefits of our platform put us in a strong position to capture the significant market opportunity ahead.  Our platform powers the Data Cloud, a network of data providers, data consumers, and data application developers that enables our customers to securely share, monetize, and acquire live data sets and data products. The Data Cloud includes access to Snowflake Marketplace, through which customers can access or acquire third-party data sets and other data products. Our future growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to increase consumption of our platform by building and expanding the Data Cloud.  Expanding Within our Existing Customer Base  Our large base of customers represents a significant opportunity for further consumption of our platform. While we have seen an increase in the number of customers that have contributed more than $1 million in product revenue in the trailing 12 months, we believe that there is a substantial opportunity to continue growing these customers further, as well as continuing to expand the usage of our platform within our other existing customers. We plan to continue investing to encourage increased consumption and adoption of new use cases among our existing customers, particularly large enterprises.  Ta ble of Contents  Once deployed, our customers often expand their use of our platform more broadly within the enterprise and across their ecosystem of customers and partners as they migrate more data to the public cloud, identify new use cases, and realize the benefits of our platform and the Data Cloud. However, because we generally recognize product revenue on consumption and not ratably over the term of the contract, we do not have visibility into the timing of revenue recognition from any particular customer. In any given period, there is a risk that customer consumption of our platform will be slower than we expect, including in response to adverse macroeconomic conditions, which may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. New software releases or hardware improvements, like better storage compression and cloud infrastructure processor improvements, may make our platform more efficient, enabling customers to consume fewer compute, storage, and data transfer resources to accomplish the same workloads. To the extent these improvements do not result in an offsetting increase in new workloads, we may experience lower revenue. In addition, we have recently seen, and may continue to see, our newer customers increase their consumption of our platform at a slower pace than our more tenured customers. Our ability to increase usage of our platform by, and sell additional contracted capacity to, existing customers, and, in particular, large enterprise customers, will depend on a number of factors, including our customers&#8217; satisfaction with our platform, competition, pricing, economic conditions, overall changes in our customers&#8217; spending levels, the effectiveness of our and our partners&#8217; efforts to help our customers realize the benefits of our platform, and the extent to which customers migrate new workloads to our platform over time.  Acquiring New Customers  We believe there is a substantial opportunity to further grow our customer base by continuing to make significant investments in sales and marketing and brand awareness. Our ability to attract new customers will depend on a number of factors, including our success in recruiting and scaling our sales and marketing organization, competitive dynamics in our target markets, changes in our customers&#8217; spending in response to market uncertainty, and our ability to build and maintain partner relationships, including with global system integrators, resellers, and technology partners. We intend to continue expanding our direct sales force, with a focus on specific industries and increasing sales to large organizations. While our platform is built for organizations of all sizes, we focus our selling efforts on large enterprise customers and customers with vast amounts of data, and providing industry-specific solutions. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force to focus on large enterprises and specific industries if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate, and retain talented and effective sales personnel; if our new and existing sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time; or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective.  Investing in Growth and Scaling our Business  We are focused on our long-term revenue potential. We believe that our market opportunity is large, and we will continue to invest significantly in scaling across all organizational functions, with a focus on research and development, and sales and marketing, in order to grow our operations both domestically and internationally. We have a history of introducing successful new features and capabilities on our platform, and we intend to continue to invest heavily to grow our business to take advantage of our expansive market opportunity while also focusing on profitability and cash flow.  Key Business Metrics  We monitor the key business metrics set forth below to help us evaluate our business and growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. The calculation of the key business metrics discussed below may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies, securities analysts, or investors.  The following tables present a summary of key business metrics for the periods presented:  ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023 2022 2021 Product revenue (in millions) $ 1,938.8 $ 1,140.5 $ 553.8 Free cash flow (non-GAAP) (in millions) (1)(2)  $ 496.5 $ 81.2 $ (85.7) ##TABLE_END Ta ble of Contents  ##TABLE_START January 31, 2023 January 31, 2022 January 31, 2021 Customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million (3)  330 184 79 Net revenue retention rate (3)  158 % 177 % 168 % Forbes Global 2000 customers (3)  573 492 403 Remaining performance obligations (in millions) (4)  $ 3,660.5 $ 2,646.5 $ 1,332.8 ##TABLE_END ________________  (1) Free cash flow for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 included the effect of $23.9 million, $68.6 million, and $14.1 million, respectively, in the net cash paid on payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions. See the section titled &#8220;Free Cash Flow&#8221; for a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.  (2) Cash outflows for employee payroll tax items related to the net share settlement of equity awards, which were $184.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, are included in cash flow for financing activities and, as a result, do not have an effect on the calculation of free cash flow. No equity awards were net settled prior to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.  (3) Historical numbers for (i) customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million, (ii) net revenue retention rate, and (iii) Forbes Global 2000 customers reflect any adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. In addition, our Forbes Global 2000 customer count reflects adjustments for annual updates to the Forbes Global 2000 list by Forbes.  (4) As of January 31, 2023, our remaining performance obligations were approximately $3.7 billion, of which we expect approximately 55% to be recognized as revenue in the twelve months ending January 31, 2024 based on historical customer consumption patterns. The weighted-average remaining life of our capacity contracts was 2.0 years as of January 31, 2023. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition are generally dependent upon customers' future consumption, which is inherently variable at our customers&#8217; discretion and can extend beyond the original contract term in cases where customers are permitted to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at renewal. In addition, our historical customer consumption patterns are not necessarily indicative of future results.  Product Revenue  Product revenue is a key metric for us because we recognize revenue based on platform consumption, which is inherently variable at our customers&#8217; discretion, and not based on the amount and duration of contract terms. Product revenue is primarily derived from the consumption of compute, storage, and data transfer resources, which are consumed by customers on our platform as a single, integrated offering. Customers have the flexibility to consume more than their contracted capacity during the contract term and may have the ability to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at renewal. Our consumption-based business model distinguishes us from subscription-based software companies that generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract term and may not permit rollover. Because customers have flexibility in the timing of their consumption, which can exceed their contracted capacity or extend beyond the original contract term in many cases, the amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is an important indicator of customer satisfaction and the value derived from our platform. While customer use of our platform in any period is not necessarily indicative of future use, we estimate future revenue using predictive models based on customers&#8217; historical usage to plan and determine financial forecasts. Product revenue excludes our professional services and other revenue, which has been less than 10% of
