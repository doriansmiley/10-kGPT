Other Income (Expense), Net  Other income (expense), net consists primarily of (i) unrealized gains (losses) on our strategic investments in equity securities, and (ii) the effect of exchange rates on our foreign currency-denominated asset and liability balances.  Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes  Provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign and U.S. federal and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets because we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest  Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Snowflake Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and a majority-owned subsidiary in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the net income (loss) of our majority-owned subsidiary attributed to noncontrolling interest using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method.

RSUs granted prior to our IPO have both a service-based and a performance-based vesting condition and, as a result of the performance-based vesting condition being satisfied in connection with our IPO, we recognized stock-based compensation associated with such RSUs using an accelerated attribution method.  As of January 31, 2023, total compensation cost related to unvested equity awards not yet recognized was $2.4 billion, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years.

Ta ble of Contents  We had 330 customers with product revenue of greater than $1 million for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2023, an increase from 184 customers as of January 31, 2022. Such customers represented approximately 62% and 56% of our product revenue for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Within these customers, we had 59 and 19 customers with product revenue of greater than $5 million and $10 million, respectively, for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2023. Approximately 96% and 93% of our revenue was derived from existing customers under capacity arrangements for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenue derived from new customers under capacity arrangements represented approximately 2% and 4% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The remainder was driven by on-demand arrangements. The preceding historical metrics reflect any adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. For purposes of determining revenue derived from (i) customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million, (ii) new customers, and (iii) existing customers, we treat each customer account, including accounts for end-customers under a reseller arrangement, that has at least one corresponding capacity contract as a unique customer, and a single organization with multiple divisions, segments, or subsidiaries may be counted as multiple customers.  Professional services and other revenue increased $48.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, as we continued to expand our professional services organization to help our customers further realize the benefits of our platform.  Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit (Loss), and Gross Margin  ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023 2022 % Change (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenue: Product $ 547,547 $ 347,817 57% Professional services and other 169,993 110,616 54% Total cost of revenue $ 717,540 $ 458,433 57% Gross profit (loss): Product $ 1,391,236 $ 792,652 76% Professional services and other (43,117) (31,758) 36% Total gross profit $ 1,348,119 $ 760,894 77% Gross margin: Product 72% 70% Professional services and other (34%) (40%) Total gross margin 65% 62% Headcount (at period end) Product 373 243 Professional services and other 488 348 Total headcount 861 591 ##TABLE_END Cost of product revenue increased $199.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase of $156.9 million in third-party cloud infrastructure expenses as a result of increased customer consumption. Personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs also increased $28.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, as a result of increased headcount and overall costs to support the growth in our business, and increased stock-based compensation primarily related to additional equity awards granted to existing and new employees. The remaining increase in cost of product revenue was primarily driven by an increase of $7.6 million in amortization of internal-use software development costs and acquired developed technology intangible assets.  Ta ble of Contents  Our product gross margin was 72% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to 70% for the prior fiscal year, primarily due to (i) increased cost efficiency as a result of cloud infrastructure processor improvements, (ii) an increased percentage of revenue from consumption of higher-priced editions of our platform, (iii) increased scale across our cloud infrastructure regions, and (iv) higher volume-based discounts for our purchases of third-party cloud infrastructure. In addition, the year-over-year increase in our product gross margin was driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation as a percentage of product revenue. While we expect our product gross margin to remain relatively flat for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2024, a number of factors could hinder any improvement in our product gross margin, including (i) fluctuations in the mix and timing of customers' consumption, which is inherently variable at our customers' discretion, (ii) whether or not a customer contracts with us through our marketplace listings, (iii) our discounting practices, including as a result of changes to the competitive environment, and (iv) the extent of our investments in our operations, including performance improvements that may make our platform or the underlying cloud infrastructure more efficient.
