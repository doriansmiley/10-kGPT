Cost of professional services and other revenue increased $59.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase of $48.3 million in personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs, as a result of increased headcount and overall costs to support the growth in our business, and increased stock-based compensation primarily related to additional equity awards granted to existing and new employees. Costs associated with contracted third-party partners, primarily related to customer implementations and migrations from legacy solutions, also increased $9.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, as a result of growth in our business.  Professional services and other gross margin improved for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to decreased stock-based compensation as a percentage of professional services and other revenue. We do not believe the year-over-year changes in professional services and other gross margins are meaningful given that we are continuing to scale our professional services organization and our professional services and other revenue represents a small percentage of our revenue.

The increase in personnel-related costs included a $60.8 million increase in stock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily related to additional equity awards granted to existing and new employees, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation related to RSUs granted prior to our IPO. See Note 12, &#8220;Equity,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Expenses associated with sales commissions and draws paid to our sales force and certain referral fees paid to third parties, including amortization of deferred commissions, increased $33.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increases in customers&#8217; consumption of our platform and in the annualized contract value of our customer contracts.  Advertising costs and other expenses associated with our sales, marketing and business development programs also increased $39.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by increased expenses related to in-person sales and marketing events and user conferences, including Summit, our annual user conference which was held virtually in the prior year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, net of associated proceeds. As a result of our in-person sales and marketing events and user conferences as well as the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions, travel-related expenses also increased $17.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year.  Ta ble of Contents  In addition, sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 included $25.2 million of amortization of an acquired developer community intangible asset as a result of the Streamlit business combination completed in March 2022.

The increase in personnel-related costs included $174.7 million increase in stock-based compensation, primarily related to additional equity awards granted to existing and new employees and the post-combination stock-based compensation related to the Streamlit business combination, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation related to RSUs granted prior to our IPO. See Note 12, &#8220;Equity,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  The remaining increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by an increase of $22.8 million in third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in developing our platform.

Unallocated lease costs, which are associated with unused office facilities to accommodate planned headcount growth, also increased $4.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year. The remaining increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased insurance expenses and increased other corporate expenses to support the normal course of operations and our continued growth.

We maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets, and the significant components of our recorded tax expense are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction&#8217;s individual tax rates, laws on the timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Our effective tax rate might fluctuate significantly and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than forecasted in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than forecasted in countries that have higher statutory rates.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of January 31, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments totaling $5.1 billion. Our investments primarily consist of corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, certificates of deposit, and money market funds.  As of January 31, 2023, our RPO was $3.7 billion. Our RPO represents the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized, including (i) deferred revenue and (ii) non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, which are not recorded on the balance sheet. Portions of RPO that are not yet invoiced and are denominated in foreign currencies are revalued into U.S. dollars each period based on the applicable period-end exchange rates.  Ta ble of Contents  Since inception, we have financed operations primarily through proceeds received from sales of equity securities and payments received from our customers. Our IPO resulted in aggregate net proceeds of $3.7 billion, after underwriting discounts of $121.7 million. We also received aggregate proceeds of $500.0 million related to certain concurrent private placements, and did not pay any underwriting discounts or commissions with respect to the shares that were sold in these private placements. Our primary uses of cash include personnel-related expenses, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses, sales and marketing expenses, overhead costs, and acquisitions and strategic investments we may make from time to time.
