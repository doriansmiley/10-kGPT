As of January 31, 2023, our material cash requirements from known contractual obligations and commitments relate primarily to (i) third-party cloud infrastructure agreements, (ii) operating leases for office facilities, and (iii) subscription arrangements used to facilitate our operations at the enterprise level. These agreements are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. In January 2023, we amended one of our third-party cloud infrastructure agreements effective February 1, 2023. Under the amended agreement, we have committed to spend an aggregate of at least $2.5 billion from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2028 on cloud infrastructure services ($350.0 million in fiscal 2024, $450.0 million in fiscal 2025, $500.0 million in fiscal 2026, $550.0 million in fiscal 2027, and $650.0 million in fiscal 2028). We are required to pay the difference if we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitment during any fiscal year, and such payment can be applied to qualifying expenditures for cloud infrastructure services during the term of the amended agreement. For more information regarding our contractual obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2023, see Note 10, &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our long-term purchase commitments may be satisfied earlier than the payment periods presented as we continue to grow and scale our business.  On February 10, 2023, we acquired (i) all outstanding stock of Mountain US Corporation (f/k/a Mobilize.net Corporation), a privately-held company which provides a premier suite of tools for efficiently migrating databases to the Data Cloud, for approximately $67 million in cash, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, and (ii) all outstanding stock of LeapYear Technologies, Inc., a privately-held company which provides a differential privacy platform, for approximately $59 million in cash, net of cash and restricted cash acquired.  In February 2023, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock. Repurchases may be effected, from time to time, either on the open market (including via pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, or through other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The program is funded using our working capital and will expire in March 2025. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.  We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments, as well as cash flows expected to be generated by our operations, will be sufficient to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, acquisitions and strategic investments we may make from time to time, and authorized stock repurchases, for the next 12 months and beyond. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, expenditures related to our headcount growth, the timing and the amount of cash received from customers, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the price at which we are able to purchase public cloud capacity, expenses associated with our international expansion, the introduction of platform enhancements, and the continuing market adoption of our platform. We may continue to enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, and technologies. We may, as a result of those arrangements or the general expansion of our business, be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Ta ble of Contents  The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 545,639 $ 110,179 $ (45,417) Net cash used in investing activities $ (597,885) $ (20,800) $ (4,036,645) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (92,624) $ 178,198 $ 4,775,290 ##TABLE_END Operating Activities  Net cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, primarily consisting of (i) stock-based compensation, net of amounts capitalized, (ii) depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and amortization of acquired intangible assets, (iii) amortization of deferred commissions, (iv) net unrealized gains or losses on strategic investments in equity securities, (v) amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets, (vi) net amortization (accretion) of premiums (discounts) on investments, and (vii) deferred income tax benefit or expense, and changes in operating assets and liabilities during each period.  For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $545.6 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $797.5 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $1.1 billion, and net cash inflows of $289.5 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of the effects of business combinations. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 were (i) a $514.3 million increase in deferred revenue due to invoicing for prepaid capacity agreements outpacing revenue recognition, and (ii) a $74.5 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to increased headcount and growth in our business, partially offset by (a) a $167.0 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to growth in our business, (b) a $95.1 million increase in deferred commissions earned upon the origination of customer contracts, and (c) a $42.3 million decrease in operating lease liabilities due to payments related to our operating lease obligations.  For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $110.2 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $679.9 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $721.7 million, and net cash inflows of $68.4 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities.  Net cash provided by operating activities increased $435.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase of $954.1 million in cash collected from customers resulting from increased sales. This was partially offset by increased expenditures due to an increase in headcount and growth in our business. We expect to continue to generate positive net cash flows from operating activities for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2024.  Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was $597.9 million, primarily as a result of (i) an aggregate of $362.6 million in cash paid for Streamlit, Applica and other business combinations, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, (ii) $185.4 million in net purchases of investments, (iii) $25.1 million in purchases of property and equipment, and (iv) $24.0 million in capitalized internal-use software development costs.  Net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 was $20.8 million, primarily as a result of purchases of investments, purchases of intangible assets, purchases of property and equipment to support our office facilities, and capitalized internal-use software development costs, partially offset by proceeds from the sales, maturities, and redemptions of investments.  Ta ble of Contents  Financing Activities  Net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was $92.6 million, primarily as a result of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee equity awards of $184.6 million, partially offset by proceeds of $80.8 million from the issuance of equity securities under our equity incentive plans, and capital contributions of $13.0 million from noncontrolling interest holders. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, we began funding withholding taxes due upon the vesting of employee RSUs in certain jurisdictions by net share settlement, rather than our previous approach of selling shares of our common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards.  Net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 was $178.2 million, primarily as a result of proceeds from the issuance of equity securities under our equity incentive plans.  Critical Accounting Estimates  Our management&#8217;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. By their nature, these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.
