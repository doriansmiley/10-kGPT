The significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 2, &#8220;Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that the accounting policies and estimates associated with revenue recognition and business combinations involve a substantial degree of judgment and complexity and therefore are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.  Revenue Recognition  Many of our contracts with customers include multiple performance obligations. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis. We consider our evaluation of SSP to be a critical accounting estimate. An observable SSP is established based on the price at which a service is sold separately. If an SSP is not observable through past transactions, we estimate it by maximizing the use of observable inputs, including the overall pricing strategy, market data, internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations, and other observable inputs. As our business and offerings evolve over time, modifications to our pricing and discounting methodologies, changes in the scope and nature of our offerings, and/or changes in customer segmentation may result in a lack of consistency, making it difficult to establish and/or maintain SSP. Changes in SSP could result in different and unanticipated allocations of revenue in contracts with multiple performance obligations. These factors, among others, may adversely impact the amount of revenue and gross margin we report in a given period.  Business Combinations  When we acquire a business, we allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated respective fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, time and resources required to recreate the assets acquired. These estimates are based on information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, our assessment of the information, and historical experience. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. The amounts and estimated useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired in business combinations impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.
