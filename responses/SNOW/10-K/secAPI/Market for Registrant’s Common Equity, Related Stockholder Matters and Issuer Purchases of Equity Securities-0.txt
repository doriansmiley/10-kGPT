 ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT&#8217;S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES  Market Price of Our Class A Common Stock  Our Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol &#8220;SNOW&#8221; and began trading on September 16, 2020. Prior to that date, there was no public trading market for our Class A common stock.  Holders of Record  As of March 1, 2023, there were 157 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock. The actual number of holders of our Class A common stock is greater than the number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held in street name by brokers or other nominees. The number of holders of record presented here also does not include stockholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities.  On March 1, 2021, all shares of our then-outstanding Class B common stock were automatically converted into the same number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. See Note 12, &#8220;Equity,&#8221; in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  Dividend Policy  We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, to fund the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.  Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans  The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the definitive Proxy Statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which will be filed with the SEC no later than 120 days after January 31, 2023.  Recent Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities  In connection with our acquisition of the outstanding capital stock of Streamlit, Inc. in March 2022, we agreed to issue 2.3 million shares of our common stock as consideration (Equity Consideration), all of which have been issued. A portion of the Equity Consideration that was issued to Streamlit&#8217;s founders (Founder Shares) are subject to vesting agreements pursuant to which the Founder Shares vest over three years, subject to each founder&#8217;s continued employment with Snowflake or its affiliates. See Note 12, &#8220;Equity,&#8221; in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  These issuances were made in reliance on one or more of the following exemptions or exclusions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act): Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.  Use of Proceeds  On September 18, 2020, we closed our IPO of 32.2 million shares of our Class A common stock at an offering price of $120.00 per share, including 4.2 million shares pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters&#8217; option to purchase additional shares of our Class A common stock, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $3.7 billion, net of the underwriting discounts. All of the shares issued and sold in our IPO were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-248280), which was declared effective by the SEC on September 15, 2020. We incurred offering expenses of approximately $0.3 million.  Immediately subsequent to the closing of our IPO, each of Salesforce Ventures LLC and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. purchased from us approximately 2.1 million shares of our Class A common stock at a price per share equal to the IPO price of $120.00 per share in two concurrent private placements. We received aggregate proceeds of $500.0 million and did not pay underwriting discounts with respect to the shares of Class A common stock that were sold in these private placements.  There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our IPO as described in our Final Prospectus for our IPO dated as of September 15, 2020 and filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on September 16, 2020.  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  None.
