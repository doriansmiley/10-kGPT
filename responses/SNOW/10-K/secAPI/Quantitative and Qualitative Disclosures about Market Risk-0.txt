 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Interest Rate Risk  As of January 31, 2023, we had $5.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, certificates of deposit, and money market funds. In addition, we had $16.8 million of restricted cash primarily due to outstanding letters of credit established in connection with lease agreements for our facilities. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments are held for working capital, capital expenditure, and general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock as well as acquisitions and strategic investments we may make from time to time. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $26.0 million or an increase of $25.9 million, respectively, in the market value of our cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments as of January 31, 2023.  As of January 31, 2022, we had $5.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments, and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $27.3 million or an increase of $23.5 million, respectively, in the market value.  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk  Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar or the Euro. The majority of our sales are currently denominated in U.S. dollars, although we also have sales in Euros and, to a lesser extent, in British pounds, Australian dollars, and Brazilian reals. Therefore our revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk, but that will likely change in the future as we increase sales in these international currencies and enable sales in additional currencies. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the United States and to a lesser extent in Europe, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific region. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at period-end exchange rates. Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates.  In order to manage our exposure to certain foreign currency exchange risks, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, we entered into deliverable foreign currency forward contracts with maturities of one month or less to hedge a portion of certain intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts reduced, but did not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. We did not enter into these forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. See Note 2, &#8220;Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.  A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates would have resulted in a theoretical increase or decrease in operating loss of approximately $32 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. This sensitivity analysis assumes that all foreign currencies move in the same direction at the same time in the absence of hedging activities. In addition, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar makes our platform more expensive for international customers, which may slow down consumption. We do not believe a 10% increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar would have had a material impact on our operating results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Ta ble of Contents  Other Market Risk  Our strategic investments consist primarily of (i) non-marketable equity securities recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, and adjusted for observable transactions for the same or similar investments of the same issuer (referred to as the Measurement Alternative), and (ii) marketable equity securities. These strategic investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks, including volatility in the public and private markets, that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of our investments and, as a result, our financial results may fluctuate. Strategic investments are subject to periodic impairment analyses, which involves an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee&#8217;s financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee&#8217;s product or technology, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash.  The following table presents our strategic investments by type (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START January 31, 2023 January 31, 2022 Equity securities: Non-marketable equity securities under Measurement Alternative $ 174,248 $ 170,860 Non-marketable equity securities under equity method 5,066 &#8212; Marketable equity securities 22,122 34,646 Debt securities: Non-marketable debt securities 1,500 2,250 Total strategic investments&#8212;included in other assets $ 202,936 $ 207,756 ##TABLE_END See Note 5, &#8220;Fair Value Measurements,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  We plan to continue these types of strategic investments as part of our corporate development program. We anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations as a result of changes in market prices, changes resulting from observable transactions for the same or similar investments of the same issuer, and impairments to our strategic investments.
