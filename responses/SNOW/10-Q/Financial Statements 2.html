<h3>Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</h3>

<p>The company has not made any significant changes to its accounting policies during the nine months ended October 31, 2022, except for the addition of the derivative financial instruments accounting policy.</p>

<h3>Derivative Financial Instruments</h3>

<p>The company has begun using derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to certain foreign currency exchange risks associated with intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The company has entered into deliverable foreign currency forward contracts with high-quality financial institutions that have investment-grade ratings with maturities of one month or less. All changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are intended to offset the foreign currency transaction gains or losses associated with the underlying intercompany balances. As of October 31, 2022, all of the company's derivative assets and liabilities were settled, and the related realized gains (losses) were not material for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022.</p>

<h3>Revenue, Accounts Receivable, Deferred Revenue, and Remaining Performance Obligations</h3>

<p>The company's revenue consists of product revenue and professional services and other revenue. Revenue by geographic area is based on the location of the company's customers or end-customers under reseller arrangements. The company's accounts receivable, net balance, includes an allowance for credit losses. For purposes of assessing the concentration of credit risk and significant customers, a group of customers under common control or customers that are affiliates of each other are regarded as a single customer. The company does not have any customers that represent 10% or more of the company's accounts receivable, net balance. There were no customers that represented 10% or more of the company's revenue for each of the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the related performance obligations are satisfied. The remaining performance obligations represent the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized, including deferred revenue and non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. As of October 31, 2022, the company's RPO was $3.0 billion, of which the company expects approximately 55% to be recognized as revenue in the twelve months ending October 31, 2023 based on historical customer consumption patterns.</p>

<h3>Cash Equivalents and Investments</h3>
