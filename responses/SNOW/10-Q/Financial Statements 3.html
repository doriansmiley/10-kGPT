The information provided in the filing suggests that the company holds available-for-sale marketable debt securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position. The fair value of the company's cash equivalents and investments has decreased from $3,526,259 as of January 31, 2022 to $3,986,550 as of October 31, 2022.

However, it is important to note that the company does not intend to sell these securities and will likely hold them until maturity or recovery of the cost basis. The decline in fair value of these securities due to credit-related factors was not material as of October 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022. 

The company's strategic investments are classified as non-marketable equity securities under the Measurement Alternative, marked-to-market measurement, or equity method. The fair value of these investments is estimated based on observable transactions for the same or similar investments of the same issuer or valuations determined using other relevant economic measures.

Despite the unrealized losses on available-for-sale marketable debt securities, the company's strong strategic investments and its intention to hold until maturity or recovery of cost basis suggest a positive outlook for potential investors.</body></html>
