Analysis:
- Amortization expenses of intangible assets have increased significantly in the current fiscal year compared to the previous year, which may indicate higher investment in acquiring intangible assets. However, it is not clear whether these assets have shown any positive impact on the financial performance of the company. 
- The increase in goodwill by $640,643k may imply that the company has recently acquired another business or made investments that will benefit the company's long-term growth. However, it is not evident how much return those investments will generate.
- The amount of total accrued expenses and other current liabilities has increased significantly from the previous fiscal year, which may indicate that the company is experiencing higher costs of expansion activities. This, however, does not necessarily indicate a negative impact on the company's financials. 
- The operating leases are non-cancelable, with various expiration dates through fiscal 2035, and modifications to one of the leases resulted in an increase in the company's operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities by approximately $ 30 million. The sublease income has also increased, which may indicate that the company is trying to optimize its lease agreements. 
- The company has reserved a significant number of common stock shares for future issuance, indicating potential expansion activities. However, there is no clear indication whether those activities will generate positive returns for the company.
- There are no significant commitments and contingencies apart from operating leases, which gives low risk for current investors.</body></html>
