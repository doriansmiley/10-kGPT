Based on the information provided, the equity incentive plans appear to be positive for potential investors. The company's 2020 plan provides for the grant of various equity awards and all available shares for future grants are under the 2020 plan. However, the 2012 plan was terminated and no further equity awards will be granted under it.

The stock option activity for the company had a positive rating with an average score. The number of shares available for grant increased by 15.6 million shares under the 2020 plan, and the table shows various options granted, exercised, canceled, and forfeited during the 9 months ended October 31, 2022. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the period was $101.66 per share, and the intrinsic value of options exercised during the period was $875.0 million.

Regarding the RSU activity, the information provided suggests that the company's RSU plan is positive. RSUs granted after the IPO only contain the service-based vesting condition, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The company began funding withholding taxes due upon the vesting of employee RSUs in certain jurisdictions by net share settlement during the 9 months ended October 31, 2022. 

The information provided on early exercised stock options and restricted common stock suggests that they are not significant enough to affect the overall evaluation of the equity incentive plans.</body></html>
