Summary:
-The company has not granted any stock options during the last 9 months and uses a simplified method to estimate expected term for "plain vanilla" options
-Prior to fiscal 2023, the company used the average volatility of a peer group of representative public companies with sufficient trading history over the expected term to develop an expected volatility assumption. The company now uses the average volatility of its Class A common stock and the stocks of a peer group of representative public companies to develop an expected volatility assumption.
-Risk-free interest rate is estimated based on quoted market yields for the United States Treasury debt securities for a term consistent with the expected life of the awards in effect at the time of grant.
-The company has never paid and has no intention to pay cash dividends on common stock, and as a result, the expected dividend yield is zero.
-Net Loss per Share is ($0.63) for the three months ended October 31, 2022, indicating a loss
-The company has a total compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards not yet recognized of $2.5 billion, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years.
-Effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2022, was 3.1%, which is relatively low
-The company maintains a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding its realization. 
-The company has applied ASC 740 and determined that it has uncertain tax positions giving rise to unrecognized tax benefits for each of the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, but no significant changes are anticipated over the next 12 months.</body></html>
