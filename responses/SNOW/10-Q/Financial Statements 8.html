Analysis:
- The first part of the statement indicates that some potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of net loss per share as their inclusion would have a negative impact. This could be viewed as negative to a potential investor.
- The second part of the statement talks about the acquisition of a privately-held company for $75 million in cash, which is a positive development for Snowflake. However, the acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions, which may impact the finalization of the agreement. 
- Overall, for a potential investor, the information is neutral as the positive and negative developments balance each other out. Therefore, the score is average.</body></html>
