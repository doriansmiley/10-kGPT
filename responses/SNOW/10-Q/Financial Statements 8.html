| Negative   | Below Average |

The exclusion of potentially dilutive securities from the calculation of diluted net loss per share is negative as it does not provide a complete picture of the company's financial health. It also potentially limits the upside gains for the common stockholders. The subsequent event of acquiring a privately-held company for approximately $75 million in cash may indicate potential growth opportunities, but the lack of information on the target company and its impact on Snowflake's financials make it difficult to assess. Therefore, the score is below average.</body></html>
