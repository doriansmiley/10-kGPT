The information provided in this section is neutral to a potential investor as it does not provide any positive or negative insights into the company's legal proceedings. The company acknowledges that they have been subject to legal proceedings and may continue to receive claims in the future, including claims of intellectual property rights infringement. However, they state that they are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on their business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. It is important to note that regardless of the outcome of any litigation, it can have an adverse impact on the company due to defense and settlement costs and diversion of management resources.
