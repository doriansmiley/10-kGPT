Summary: 

1. Revenue for each of the periods presented:
The company recognizes revenue from capacity arrangements, on-demand arrangements, and annual deployment fees. Revenue from on-demand arrangements represents less than 3% of the company's total revenue for each of the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021. The weighted-average term of capacity contracts entered into during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, is 2.5 years and 2.2 years, respectively.

2. Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO):
The RPO represents the contracted future revenue that is yet to be recognized, which includes deferred revenue and non-cancelable contracted amounts. It is updated each period based on the applicable period-end exchange rates. However, the RPO is not necessarily indicative of future product revenue growth, as it does not account for the timing of customers' consumption or their consumption of more than their contracted capacity. 

3. Total Customers:
The company counts the total number of customers at the end of each period, which is an important indicator of future revenue trends. For this purpose, each customer account, including accounts for end-customers under a reseller arrangement, that has at least one corresponding capacity contract is treated as a unique customer. 

4. Net Revenue Retention Rate:
The company's dollar-based net revenue retention rate is an important measure of the health of its business and future growth prospects. It calculates the retention rate over a measurement period consisting of the trailing two years from the current period end. The company's net retention rate is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. 

5. Customers with Trailing 12-Month Product Revenue Greater than $1 Million:
The company's ability to scale with its customers and attract large enterprises to its platform is measured by the number of customers under capacity arrangements that contributed more than $1 million in product revenue in the trailing 12 months. 

6. Free Cash Flow:
The company defines free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software development costs. The company believes that information regarding free cash flow provides useful supplemental information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of its core business operations. 

Overall, the information presented in this page of the filing appears to be positive for a potential investor. The company's revenue streams are diverse, and it has a strong customer base with a high retention rate. Additionally, the company generates significant free cash flow, indicating strong financial performance.</body></html>
