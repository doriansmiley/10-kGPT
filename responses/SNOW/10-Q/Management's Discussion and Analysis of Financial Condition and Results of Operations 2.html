Summary:

- Revenue for each period presented was not explicitly mentioned as a separate metric from the information provided.
- Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) were discussed as a contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized. RPO is not necessarily indicative of future product revenue growth because it does not account for the timing of customers' consumption or their consumption of more than their contracted capacity. Given the nature of the metric, it does not provide a clear positive or negative indicator of future performance.
- Total Customers were counted at the end of each period, indicating an important indicator of growth of the business and potential future revenue trends. 
- Net Revenue Retention Rate was calculated as a measure of growth in use of their platform by existing customers. The metric is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. The rate is expected to decrease over the long term as customers that have consumed their platform for an extended period of time become a larger portion of both their overall customer base and their product revenue that they use to calculate net revenue retention rate. This metric indicates an important measure of the health of their business and future growth prospects.
- Customers with Trailing 12-Month Product Revenue Greater than $1 Million were counted in terms of their ability to scale with large enterprises. This indicates an ability to sell additional capacity to larger customers due to their larger budgets and wider range of potential use cases. 
- Free Cash Flow was defined as a non-GAAP financial measure, indicating an indicator of the strength and performance of their core business operations. Historically, higher free cash flow is seen in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of each year. 

Overall, while some metrics were neutral in providing future performance insights, other metrics such as total customers, net revenue retention rate, and customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million provide positive indicators for potential investors.</body></html>
