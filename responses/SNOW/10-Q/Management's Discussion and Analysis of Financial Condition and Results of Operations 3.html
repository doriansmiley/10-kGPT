Summary: The information provided in the extracted page may be viewed as negative for a potential investor. The company generates a majority of revenue from fees charged to customers based on storage, compute, and data transfer resources consumed on the platform. However, the company does not make any of these resources available for consumption without others, which creates a risk that customers may consume slower, causing fluctuations in revenue and results of operations. New software releases and hardware improvements may also make the platform more efficient, leading to fewer resources being consumed, resulting in lower revenue. The company intends to continue to invest additional resources in their platform infrastructure, which may affect gross margin from period to period. Additionally, the company's operating expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and sales commissions, which are the most significant component of operating expenses. The company's sales and marketing expenses continue to be their largest operating expense, and they expect it to increase in absolute dollars as the business grows. The research and development expenses will also increase as the business grows, particularly as they incur additional costs related to continued investments in the platform. They maintain a full valuation allowance against the U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets because it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The table provided shows the company's condensed consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated.</body></html>
