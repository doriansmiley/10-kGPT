The revenue for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, increased 67% and 77%, respectively compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in revenue is due to the increased consumption of the platform by existing customers, which is evident in the net revenue retention rate of 165% as of October 31, 2022. The cost of revenue for product increased but overall gross profit increased by 71% and 89% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively compared to the same periods in the prior year. The total headcount increased by 278 (53%) from 523 at October 31, 2021, to 801 at October 31, 2022. Although stock-based compensation increased in terms of the percentage of revenue, the increase was primarily attributable to additional equity awards granted to current and new employees, and partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation associated with restricted stock unit awards. However, net loss attributable to Snowflake Inc. was still high at $589.5 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2022.</body></html>
