The information in the filing suggests a negative outlook for a potential investor, scoring below average. The increase in professional services and other revenue is primarily due to a rise in personnel-related and contracted third-party partner costs. Although gross margins have improved, the change is not deemed significant as this revenue represents a small percentage of the total revenue. Sales and marketing expenses have significantly increased for both the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, compared to the prior periods due to higher overhead costs, headcount growth, increased staff, and marketing events. Research and development costs also grew by a sizeable amount due to the increased allocation of overhead expenses and headcount growth. Meanwhile, general and administration expenses have increased slightly because of higher headcount, legal fees, and lease costs. Finally, other income (expense), net, has decreased compared to the prior periods due to impairments and net unrealized losses on investments.</body></html>
