The information suggests significant increase in expenses associated with sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, compared to the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021. These increases result from increased headcount, overall costs, and stock-based compensation, reflecting the growth in business. Additionally, the other income (expense), net decreased substantially, mainly due to impairments recorded on non-marketable equity securities and net unrealized losses. The interest income increased primarily due to higher yields on investments in available-for-sale marketable debt securities resulting from increased interest rates. Overall, the data suggests an increase in operating costs and a decrease in other income, impacting profitability negatively.</body></html>
