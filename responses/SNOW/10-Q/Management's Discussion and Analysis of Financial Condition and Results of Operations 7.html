The net cash used in investing activities increased significantly from $57 million to $533.1 million, indicating a larger use of cash for business combinations, net purchases of investments, and purchases of property and equipment. The net cash used in financing activities decreased from $142.7 million to $52.5 million due to a decrease in proceeds from issuing equity securities under equity incentive plans, and an increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards. 

The critical accounting estimates section discloses that estimates and assumptions are made by management in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements, which could significantly affect the financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. While there have been no significant changes to the critical accounting estimates, the materiality of the section raises concerns.

The information provided suggests negative trends for increased spending in investing activities and decreased financing activities. The critical accounting estimates information could also pose a risk to financial statement accuracy.</body></html>
