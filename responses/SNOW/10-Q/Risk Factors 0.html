The Risk Factors section highlights several areas of concern for potential investors. First, the rapid revenue growth and limited operating history of the company make it difficult to forecast future results accurately. The company acknowledges that its historical revenue growth may not be indicative of future performance, and its revenue growth rate is expected to decline in future periods.

Second, the company's consumption-based business model makes it challenging to have visibility into its future financial position and results of operations, which could lead to misunderstandings from investors and analysts and negatively impact the trading price of its common stock.

Third, the company has a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. This is due to its continued investment in the platform's development, expanding its sales and marketing teams, and retaining employees.

Fourth, the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive, and new technologies and competitors continue to enter these markets. The company's significant competitors include large, well-established public cloud providers, less-established public and private cloud companies, other established vendors of legacy database solutions or big data offerings, and new or emerging entrants seeking to develop competing technologies.

Finally, the company must continue to innovate in response to changing customer needs, new technologies, or other market requirements, or risk being left behind in a rapidly evolving market.

Overall, while the company's revenue growth has been impressive, the numerous uncertainties and risks associated with the business model and market competition make it a below-average investment option for potential investors.</body></html>
