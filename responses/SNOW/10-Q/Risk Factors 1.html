The information provided in the extracted page shows some significant risks and challenges for the company. The company's platform relies on third-party public cloud infrastructure to operate, and any disruption, outage, or performance problems with the infrastructure could result in reduced use of the platform, increased expenses, including service credit obligations, and harm to the brand and reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, the platform processes, stores, and transmits customers' and partners' proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data, which poses a significant risk of data breaches and cyber-attacks from a variety of sources, including hackers, internal and external personnel, nation-states, and malware. Any security breach of the platform or the systems of third-party service providers or sub-processors could result in litigation, indemnity obligations, regulatory enforcement actions, investigations, fines, penalties, disputes, reputational harm, diversion of management's attention, and other liabilities and damage to the business. 

Furthermore, the company faces evolving industry standards and regulations, resulting in increasing data governance and compliance requirements for the company and its customers and partners. The company may need to address additional requirements specific to those markets if it expands further into the public sector and highly regulated countries and industries. Fluctuations in financial results and failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors with respect to the results of operations could lead to a decline in the stock price. 

All of these risks and challenges could adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects of the company. Therefore, the rating is negative, and the score is below average.</body></html>
