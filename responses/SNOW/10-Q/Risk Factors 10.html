Summary: The extracted page highlights multiple provisions in the company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation that may limit potential acquirers and frustrate or prevent attempts by stockholders to replace or remove the current management. The anti-takeover provisions, if effective, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of the company. In addition, the choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the company's directors, officers, or other employees. All these provisions combined could result in the company being perceived as less attractive to potential investors, thus reducing the likelihood of a premium for their shares in an acquisition. Also, the failure to maintain internal controls over financial reporting could severely inhibit the company's ability to accurately report the financial status to the investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of their common stock.</body></html>
