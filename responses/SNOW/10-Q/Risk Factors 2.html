The page extracted from the filing highlights several potential risks and challenges that could negatively affect the company's financial performance and investor's returns. The company faces risks associated with changes in demand for its platform, fluctuations in usage of its platform, ability to attract and retain customers, customer expansion rates, and investments to expand the capacity of public cloud providers.

Additionally, the company may experience negative impacts from unfavorable general economic conditions, including pandemics such as COVID-19, changes in customers' budgets, and cash flows. The company's growth is highly dependent on the development, expansion, and success of its partner relationships, which may not succeed.

Furthermore, expanding the company's sales and marketing capabilities could harm its ability to increase its customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of its platform. There are risks involved while selling to large customers, such as longer sales cycles, complex customer requirements, and substantial upfront sales costs.

Overall, investors should be aware of these potential risks before investing in the company, which may negatively impact the company's financial performance and investor's returns.</body></html>
