Analysis:

The extracted page from the 10-Q filing contains several negative factors that could impact the potential investor's decision making.

Firstly, the company's revenue stream is reliant on partnerships with global system integrators, managed service providers, and resellers. However, there may not be enough qualified partners available to meet customer demands, and new partners may require extensive training or resources to become productive. This could impact customer acquisition and expansion attempts and, in turn, impact operating results and growth rate. 

The company's success also depends on its professional services business, which has grown as product revenue has increased. However, if the company fails to improve its profit margin from these services or manage its growth effectively, operating results, including profit margins, could suffer.

Another key factor that could impact the company's performance is related to hiring and retaining highly qualified personnel. The competition for experienced personnel is intense, and companies with more significant resources may offer more appealing compensation packages, making it challenging to attract and retain suitable candidates. 

Moreover, the company's contracts with customers, investors, and other third parties include indemnification provisions, exposing it to potential substantial liability claims, such as alleged infringement, misappropriation, or violation of intellectual property rights. 

Finally, the company's acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could pose integration challenges, disrupt its business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Considering these factors, the potential investor is likely to have a below-average outlook for the company's growth prospects.</body></html>
