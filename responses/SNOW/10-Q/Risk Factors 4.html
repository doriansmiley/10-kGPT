The page extracted from the 10-Q filing suggests several risks associated with the company's business operations. Firstly, their strategic investments, ranging from early stage companies to mature companies, are subject to uncertainties related to achieving desired synergies and investing capital, which could lead to substantial impairment charges. Secondly, the company faces significant risks and uncertainties while doing business with federal, state, local, and foreign governments due to regulatory determinations, termination of contracts, and compliance with government contracting requirements. These risks include difficulty in predicting the timing of entering into customer agreements, termination of contracts due to non-compliance, and potential civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Thirdly, doing business with customers and partners in heavily regulated industries, such as the financial services and health care industries, may expose the company to heightened risks of compliance requirements and limitations in expanding their business. Fourthly, the company may become subject to costly legal proceedings and claims, such as those related to commercial disputes, employment claims, and securities class actions or other claims. 

Overall, the risks outlined in the extracted page suggest significant uncertainty and potential unfavorable consequences to a potential investor, meriting a below-average score.</body></html>
