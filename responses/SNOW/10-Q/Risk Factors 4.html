The information provided in the SEC filings suggests that there are several risks associated with the company's business operations. The company's management is cautious while highlighting that strategic investments are subject to risk, and failure to achieve expected synergies may result in substantial impairment charges. Additionally, the seasonality may cause fluctuations in the performance of the remaining performance obligations, with higher non-GAAP free cash flow in the first and fourth fiscal quarters.

Furthermore, the company faces significant risks in doing business with government entities and heavily regulated organizations. Compliance with complex laws, regulations, and contractual provisions relating to government contracts imposes compliance obligations that may result in administrative sanctions or penalties. Moreover, litigation might result in substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and seriously harm the company's financial position. The company's involvement in heavily regulated industries could also limit its ability to continue or expand its business if customers determine that some aspects of its business do not meet regulatory requirements.

Overall, the information in the SEC filings suggests that the company operates in a challenging environment, and there may be several risks that could adversely affect its financial performance. Therefore, the score is below average.</body></html>
