Analysis:
The information extracted from the filing points to several risks associated with investing in the company. The disclosure shows that changes in tax laws, tax treaties, and regulations might result in an adverse effect on the company&#8217;s results of operations. This would point to instability in earnings and subsequent uncertainty for investors. The volatility of the company's stock price coupled with the lack of control over price interpretation by analysts and the delay in dividend payouts is also a negative indicator for prospective investors. The disclosure further noted that operating as a public company presents significant legal, accounting, compliance, and other expenses that the company did not incur as a private company. It also imposes various requirements on public companies such as reporting requirements and increased legal and financial compliance costs. These factors could increase costs and reduce profitability, and this reflective of a higher risk investment. As such, the negative overall score indicates that the company may not be a suitable investment for risk-averse investors.</body></html>
