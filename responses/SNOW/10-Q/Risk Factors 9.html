The information provided in the filing suggests a number of risks that may have an adverse effect on the company's financial results, which in turn may negatively impact investors. These risks include uncertainties in tax determinations and changes in tax regulations, which may result in an increase in the company's effective tax rate. Additionally, the market price of the company's stock is highly volatile and subject to several factors beyond its control, such as changes in financial or operational performance, data breaches, litigation, changes in senior management, and general economic and market conditions. The company's decision to not pay dividends in the foreseeable future may cause investors to rely on capital appreciation alone to achieve a return on their investment. Furthermore, being a public company subjects the company to significant legal, accounting, compliance, and other expenses that it did not incur as a private company. Compliance with these requirements could also increase the company's costs and make activities more time-consuming and costly. Finally, being a public company requires the company to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence and the value of the company's common stock. Overall, the risks identified in the filing suggest a negative outlook for potential investors, with a score below average.</body></html>
