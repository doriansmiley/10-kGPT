The information provided in Item 2 is generally positive for a potential investor. The recent sale of equity securities was for the acquisition of Streamlit, Inc., which could potentially enhance the Snowflake's product and service offerings. Moreover, the use of proceeds from the IPO has not deviated from the original plan. However, the portion of the equity consideration issued to the Streamlit's founders is subject to vesting agreements, which may affect the stability of these key personnel's tenure.

Therefore, based on the performance of an average high growth company, the score would be an average rating because the positive and negative aspects of the disclosure balance each other out.</body></html>
