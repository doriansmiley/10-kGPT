SNOWFLAKE INC.  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (unaudited)  1. Organization and Description of Business  Snowflake Inc. (Snowflake or the Company) provides a cloud-based data platform, which enables customers to consolidate data to drive meaningful business insights, build data-driven applications, and share data. The Company provides its platform through a customer-centric, consumption-based business model, only charging customers for the resources they use. Through its platform, the Company delivers the Data Cloud, a network where Snowflake customers, partners, data providers, and data consumers can break down data silos and derive value from rapidly growing data sets in secure, governed, and compliant ways. Snowflake was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 23, 2012.  2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Fiscal Year  The Company&#8217;s fiscal year ends on January 31. For example, references to fiscal 2023 refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all disclosures normally required in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on March 30, 2022.  In management&#8217;s opinion, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the Company&#8217;s financial position as of October 31, 2022 and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, and cash flows for the nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021. The condensed balance sheet as of January 31, 2022 was derived from the audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other future interim or annual period.  Principles of Consolidation  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Snowflake Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and a majority-owned subsidiary in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company records noncontrolling interest in its condensed consolidated financial statements to recognize the minority ownership interest in its majority-owned subsidiary. Profits and losses of the majority-owned subsidiary are attributed to controlling and noncontrolling interests using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method.  Segment Information  The Company has a single operating and reportable segment. The Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer, who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance, and allocating resources. For information regarding the Company&#8217;s revenue by geographic area, see Note 3.  The following table presents the Company&#8217;s long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, by geographic area (in thousands):  October 31, 2022 January 31, 2022 United States $ 322,199 &#160; $ 272,895 &#160;  Other (1)  58,453 &#160; 22,540 &#160; Total $ 380,652 &#160; $ 295,435 &#160;  ________________  (1) No individual country outside of the United States accounted for more than 10% of the Company&#8217;s long-lived assets as of October 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022.
