Use of Estimates  The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, stand-alone selling prices (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation, internal-use software development costs, the expected period of benefit for deferred commissions, the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the carrying value of operating lease right-of-use assets, stock-based compensation, accounting for income taxes, and the fair value of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities.  The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and also on assumptions that management considers reasonable. These estimates are assessed on a regular basis; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  The Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies are discussed in &#8220;Note 2 &#8211; Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on March 30, 2022. There have been no significant changes to these policies during the nine months ended October 31, 2022, except for the addition of the derivative financial instruments accounting policy with respect to the Company&#8217;s foreign currency forward contracts entered into during the nine months ended October 31, 2022.  Derivative Financial Instruments  During the nine months ended October 31, 2022, the Company began using derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to certain foreign currency exchange risks associated with certain intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable foreign currency forward contracts entered into with high-quality financial institutions that have investment-grade ratings with maturities of one month or less and are not designated as hedging instruments. As such, all changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in other income (expense), net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations, and are intended to offset the foreign currency transaction gains or losses associated with the underlying intercompany balances. The resulting derivative assets and liabilities are measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs and presented as prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, as applicable, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Cash flows at settlement of such foreign currency forward contracts are classified as operating activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.  As of October 31, 2022, all of the Company&#8217;s derivative assets and liabilities were settled, and the related realized gains (losses) were not material for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022.  3.

(2) Includes Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.  Accounts Receivable, Net  As of October 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022, allowance for credit losses of $ 2.2 million and $ 1.3 million, was included in the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable, net balance, respectively.  Significant Customers  For purposes of assessing the concentration of credit risk and significant customers, a group of customers under common control or customers that are affiliates of each other are regarded as a single customer. As of October 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022, there were no customers that represented 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable, net balance. Additionally, there were no customers that represented 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s revenue for each of the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021.  Deferred Revenue  Revenue recognized for the three months ended October 31, 2022 from amounts included in deferred revenue as of July 31, 2022 was $ 427.4 million. Revenue recognized for the three months ended October 31, 2021 from amounts included in deferred revenue as of July 31, 2021 was $ 255.0 million.  Revenue recognized for the nine months ended October 31, 2022 from amounts included in deferred revenue as of January 31, 2022 was $ 841.8 million. Revenue recognized for the nine months ended October 31, 2021 from amounts included in deferred revenue as of January 31, 2021 was $ 464.0 million.  Remaining Performance Obligations  Remaining performance obligations (RPO) represent the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized, including (i) deferred revenue and (ii) non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. The Company&#8217;s RPO excludes performance obligations from on-demand arrangements as there are no minimum purchase commitments associated with these arrangements, and certain time and materials contracts that are billed in arrears. Portions of RPO that are not yet invoiced and are denominated in foreign currencies are revalued into U.S. dollars each period based on the applicable period-end exchange rates.  As of October 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s RPO was $ 3.0 billion, of which the Company expects approximately 55 % to be recognized as revenue in the twelve months ending October 31, 2023 based on historical customer consumption patterns. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition are generally dependent upon customers&#8217; future consumption, which is inherently variable at customers&#8217; discretion and can extend beyond the original contract term in cases where customers are permitted to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally on the purchase of additional capacity at renewal.  4.

The Company did not recognize an allowance for credit losses against interest receivable as of October 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022 because such potential losses were not material.  As of October 31, 2022, the contractual maturities of the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale marketable debt securities did not exceed 36 months. The estimated fair values of available-for-sale marketable debt securities, by remaining contractual maturity, are as follows (in thousands):
