See Note 5 for information regarding the Company&#8217;s strategic investments.  5. Fair Value Measurements  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value as follows:  Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.  Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.  The following table presents the fair value hierarchy for the Company&#8217;s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2022 (in thousands):  Level 1  Level 2  Total  Cash equivalents:  Money market funds $ 425,221 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 425,221 &#160; Commercial paper &#8212; &#160; 89,807 &#160; 89,807 &#160; Corporate notes and bonds &#8212; &#160; 1,600 &#160; 1,600 &#160; Short-term investments:  Corporate notes and bonds &#8212; &#160; 1,715,493 &#160; 1,715,493 &#160; Commercial paper &#8212; &#160; 779,117 &#160; 779,117 &#160; Certificates of deposit &#8212; &#160; 405,839 &#160; 405,839 &#160; U.S. government and agency securities &#8212; &#160; 223,430 &#160; 223,430 &#160; Long-term investments:  Corporate notes and bonds &#8212; &#160; 583,864 &#160; 583,864 &#160; U.S. government and agency securities &#8212; &#160; 359,217 &#160; 359,217 &#160; Total  $ 425,221 &#160; $ 4,158,367 &#160; $ 4,583,588 &#160;  The following table presents the fair value hierarchy for the Company&#8217;s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 31, 2022 (in thousands):  Level 1  Level 2  Total  Cash equivalents:  Money market funds $ 722,492 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 722,492 &#160; Commercial paper &#8212; &#160; 77,794 &#160; 77,794 &#160; U.S. government securities &#8212; &#160; 36,995 &#160; 36,995 &#160; Corporate notes and bonds &#8212; &#160; 7,949 &#160; 7,949 &#160; Short-term investments:  Corporate notes and bonds &#8212; &#160; 1,662,436 &#160; 1,662,436 &#160; Commercial paper &#8212; &#160; 883,636 &#160; 883,636 &#160; U.S. government and agency securities &#8212; &#160; 116,712 &#160; 116,712 &#160; Certificates of deposit &#8212; &#160; 103,580 &#160; 103,580 &#160; Long-term investments:  Corporate notes and bonds &#8212; &#160; 935,603 &#160; 935,603 &#160; U.S. government and agency securities &#8212; &#160; 320,207 &#160; 320,207 &#160; Certificates of deposit &#8212; &#160; 397 &#160; 397 &#160; Total  $ 722,492 &#160; $ 4,145,309 &#160; $ 4,867,801 &#160;  The Company determines the fair value of its security holdings based on pricing from the Company&#8217;s service providers and market prices from industry-standard independent data providers. Such market prices may be quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 inputs) or pricing determined using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs), such as yield curve, volatility factors, credit spreads, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt, broker and dealer quotes, as well as other relevant economic measures.  Strategic Investments  The tables above do not include the Company&#8217;s strategic investments, which consist primarily of (i) non-marketable equity securities recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, and adjusted for observable transactions for the same or similar investments of the same issuer (referred to as the Measurement Alternative), and (ii) marketable equity securities.  The Company&#8217;s non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the Measurement Alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis and classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market are used in estimating their fair value. The estimation of fair value for these assets requires the use of an observable transaction price or other unobservable inputs, including the volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities the Company holds. The Company&#8217;s marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using the quoted market price.
