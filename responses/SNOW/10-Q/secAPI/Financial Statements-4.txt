(2) Deferred tax liabilities, net primarily relates to the intangible asset acquired and the amount presented is net of deferred tax assets.  The fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was estimated using the replacement cost method, which utilizes assumptions for the cost to replace it, such as time and resources required, as well as a theoretical profit margin and opportunity cost.  Acquisition-related costs of $ 3.4 million associated with this business combination were recorded as a general and administrative expense during the nine months ended October 31, 2022.  The results of operations of Applica from the date of acquisition, which were not material, have been included in the Company&#8217;s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022.  Streamlit, Inc.  On March 31, 2022, the Company acquired all outstanding stock of Streamlit, Inc. (Streamlit), a privately-held company which provides an open-source framework for creating and deploying data applications. The Company acquired Streamlit primarily for its talent and developer community. The Company has accounted for this transaction as a business combination. The acquisition date fair value of the purchase consideration was $ 650.8 million, which was comprised of the following (in thousands):  Estimated Fair Value Cash $ 211,839 &#160; Common stock (1)  438,916 &#160; Total  $ 650,755 &#160; ________________  (1) Approximately 1.9 million shares of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock were included in the purchase consideration and the fair values of these shares were determined based on the closing market price of $ 229.13 per share on the acquisition date.  In addition, in connection with this business combination, the Company issued to Streamlit&#8217;s three founders a total of 0.4 million shares of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock in exchange for a portion of their Streamlit stock. These shares are subject to vesting agreements pursuant to which the shares will vest over three years , subject to each founder&#8217;s continued employment with the Company or its affiliates. The $ 93.7 million fair value of these shares are accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation over the requisite service period of three years . See Note 10 for further discussion.  The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of purchase consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition:  Estimated Fair Value (in thousands) Estimated Useful Life (in years) Cash and cash equivalents $ 33,914 &#160; Goodwill (1)  494,165 &#160; Developer community intangible asset 150,000 &#160; 5  Other net tangible liabilities ( 660 ) Deferred tax liabilities, net (2)  ( 26,664 ) Total $ 650,755 &#160;  ________________  (1) The excess of purchase consideration over the preliminary fair value of identifiable net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes.  (2) Deferred tax liabilities, net primarily relates to the intangible asset acquired and the amount presented is net of deferred tax assets.  The fair value of the developer community intangible asset was estimated using the replacement cost method which utilizes assumptions for the cost to replace it, such as time and resources required, as well as a theoretical profit margin and opportunity cost.  Acquisition-related costs of $ 2.0 million associated with this business combination were recorded as a general and administrative expense during the nine months ended October 31, 2022.  From the date of acquisition through October 31, 2022, revenue attributable to Streamlit was not material. It was impracticable to determine the effect on the Company's net loss attributable to Streamlit as its operations have been integrated into the Company's ongoing operations since the date of acquisition.  During the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill for these business combinations. The excess of purchase consideration over the preliminary fair value of identifiable net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The Company believes the goodwill balances associated with these business combinations represent the synergies expected from expanded market opportunities when integrating the acquired developed technologies with the Company&#8217;s offerings.
