Commitments and Contingencies  Operating Leases  The Company leases its facilities for office space under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2035. Certain lease agreements include options to renew or terminate the lease, which are not reasonably certain to be exercised and therefore are not factored into the determination of lease payments.  In May 2022, the Company entered into an agreement related to the expansion and lease term extension of an existing office facility located in the United States, which is considered a lease modification not accounted for as a separate contract. Total commitment, net of tenant incentives expected to be received, under the modified lease is $ 68.0 million. The modified lease commenced during the nine months ended October 31, 2022, with an expiration date in fiscal 2035, and resulted in an increase in the Company&#8217;s operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in the amount of approximately $ 30 million.  In addition, the Company subleases certain of its unoccupied facilities to third parties with various expiration dates through fiscal 2030. Such subleases have all been classified as operating leases. Sublease income is recorded as a reduction to the Company&#8217;s operating lease costs. Sublease income was $ 3.0 million and $ 9.7 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, and $ 3.4 million and $ 9.8 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively.  Other Contractual Commitments &#8212;Other contractual commitments relate mainly to third-party cloud infrastructure agreements and subscription arrangements used to facilitate the Company&#8217;s operations at the enterprise level. There were no material contractual obligations that were entered into during the nine months ended October 31, 2022 that were outside the ordinary course of business.  401(k) Plan &#8212;The Company sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering all eligible U.S. employees. Contributions to the 401(k) plan are discretionary. The Company did not make any matching contributions to the 401(k) plan for each of the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021.  Legal Matters &#8212;The Company is involved from time to time in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company believes that none of its current legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows for each of the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021.  Letters of Credit &#8212;As of October 31, 2022, the Company had a total of $ 16.8 million in cash collateralized letters of credit outstanding, substantially in favor of certain landlords for the Company&#8217;s leased facilities. These letters of credit renew annually and expire at various dates through fiscal 2033.  Indemnification &#8212;The Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including business partners, investors, contractors, customers, and the Company&#8217;s officers, directors, and certain employees. The Company has agreed to indemnify and defend the indemnified party for claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party from actual or threatened third-party claims due to the Company&#8217;s activities or non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by the Company. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the Company&#8217;s limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. For each of the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisions were not material.  10. Equity  Preferred Stock &#8212;In connection with its Initial Public Offering (IPO), the Company&#8217;s amended and restated certificate of incorporation became effective, which authorized the issuance of 200.0 million shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.0001 per share and with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the board of directors.  Common Stock and Elimination of Dual-Class Structure &#8212;The Company has two classes of common stock authorized: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. In connection with the IPO, the Company&#8217;s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorized the issuance of 2,500.0 million shares of Class A common stock and 355.0 million shares of Class B common stock. On March 1, 2021, all 169.5 million shares of the Company's then-outstanding Class B common stock, par value $ 0.0001 per share, were automatically converted into the same number of shares of Class A common stock, par value $ 0.0001 per share, pursuant to the terms of the Company&#8217;s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. No additional shares of Class B common stock will be issued following such conversion.  The shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock were identical prior to the conversion, except with respect to voting, converting, and transfer rights. Prior to the conversion, each share of Class B common stock was entitled to cast ten votes per share on any matter submitted to a vote of the Company&#8217;s stockholders. As a result of the conversion, all former holders of shares of Class B common stock are now holders of shares of Class A common stock, which is entitled to only one vote per share on all matters subject to a stockholder vote. Class A and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive any dividends as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors.  Prior to the conversion, shares of Class B common stock were convertible to Class A common stock at any time at the option of the stockholder, and shares of Class B common stock would automatically convert to Class A common stock upon the following: (i) sale or transfer of such share of Class B common stock; (ii) the death of the Class B common stockholder (or nine months after the date of death if the stockholder is one of the Company&#8217;s founders); and (iii) on the final conversion date, defined as the earlier to occur following an IPO of (a) the first trading day on or after the date on which the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represented less than 10 % of the then outstanding Class A and Class B common stock; (b) September 15, 2027, which is the seventh anniversary of the effectiveness of the registration statement filed in connection with the IPO; or (c) the date specified by a vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a single class.  In addition, on March 3, 2021, the Company filed a certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware effecting the retirement of the shares of Class B common stock that were issued but no longer outstanding following the conversion. Upon the effectiveness of the certificate, the Company&#8217;s total number of authorized shares of capital stock was reduced by the retirement of 169.5 million shares of Class B common stock.  The Company had reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows (in thousands):  October 31, 2022 January 31, 2022 2012 Equity Incentive Plan: Options outstanding 36,464 &#160; 42,043 &#160; Restricted stock units outstanding 3,003 &#160; 4,530 &#160; 2020 Equity Incentive Plan: Options outstanding 642 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Restricted stock units outstanding 12,558 &#160; 5,082 &#160; Shares available for future grants 53,544 &#160; 45,446 &#160; 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan: Shares available for future grants 11,046 &#160; 8,209 &#160; Total shares of common stock reserved for future issuance 117,257 &#160; 105,310 &#160;
