Equity Incentive Plans &#8212;The Company&#8217;s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (2020 Plan), which became effective in connection with the IPO, provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards (RSUs), performance awards and other forms of equity compensation (collectively, equity awards). All shares that remain available for future grants are under the 2020 Plan.  The Company&#8217;s 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (2012 Plan) provided for the grant of equity awards to employees, non-employee directors, and other service providers of the Company. The 2012 Plan was terminated in September 2020 in connection with the IPO but continues to govern the terms of outstanding awards that were granted prior to the termination of the 2012 Plan. Upon the expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, or reacquisition of any shares of common stock underlying outstanding equity awards granted under the 2012 Plan, an equal number of shares of Class A common stock will become available for grant under the 2020 Plan. No further equity awards will be granted under the 2012 Plan.  The Company&#8217;s 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2020 ESPP), which became effective in connection with the IPO, authorizes the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to employees. Offering periods are generally six months long and begin on March 15 and September 15 of each year, except for the first two offering periods. The initial offering period began on September 15, 2020 and ended on February 26, 2021. The second offering period began on March 1, 2021 and ended on September 14, 2021.  On February 1, 2022, the shares available for grant under the 2020 Plan and the 2020 ESPP were automatically increased by 15.6 million shares and 3.1 million shares, respectively, pursuant to the annual evergreen increase provisions under the 2020 Plan and the 2020 ESPP.  Stock Options &#8212;Stock options granted under the 2012 Plan and the 2020 Plan (collectively, the Plans) generally vest based on continued service over four years and expire ten years from the date of grant. Certain stock options granted under the 2012 Plan are exercisable at any time following the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant.  A summary of stock option activity and activity regarding shares available for grant under the Plans during the nine months ended October 31, 2022 is as follows:  Shares Available for Grant (in thousands) Number of Options Outstanding (in thousands) Weighted- Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands)  Balance&#8212;January 31, 2022  45,446 &#160; 42,043 &#160; $ 7.53 &#160; 6.9 $ 11,283,299 &#160; Shares authorized 15,619 &#160; &#8212; $ &#8212; Options granted ( 642 ) 642 &#160; $ 207.56 &#160; Options exercised &#8212; ( 2,448 ) $ 6.18 &#160; Options canceled 400 &#160; ( 400 ) $ 6.98 &#160; RSUs granted ( 5,763 ) &#8212; Shares withheld related to net share settlement of RSUs 292 &#160; &#8212; RSUs forfeited 327 &#160; &#8212;  Balance&#8212;April 30, 2022  55,679 &#160; 39,837 &#160; $ 10.84 &#160; 6.7 $ 6,421,133 &#160; Options exercised &#8212; ( 1,494 ) $ 5.65 &#160; Options canceled 180 &#160; ( 180 ) $ 7.32 &#160; RSUs granted ( 1,374 ) &#8212; Shares withheld related to net share settlement of RSUs 260 &#160; &#8212; RSUs forfeited 462 &#160; &#8212;  Balance&#8212;July 31, 2022  55,207 &#160; 38,163 &#160; $ 11.06 &#160; 6.5 $ 5,336,155 &#160; Options exercised &#8212; ( 984 ) $ 7.49 &#160; Options canceled 73 ( 73 ) $ 8.32 &#160; RSUs granted ( 2,361 ) &#8212; Shares withheld related to net share settlement of RSUs 274 &#8212; RSUs forfeited 351 &#8212;  Balance&#8212;October 31, 2022  53,544 &#160; 37,106 &#160; $ 11.16 &#160; 6.2 $ 5,564,360 &#160; Vested and exercisable as of October 31, 2022  28,513 &#160; $ 7.81 &#160; 6.0 $ 4,352,427 &#160;  The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the nine months ended October 31, 2022 was $ 101.66 per share. No options were granted during the nine months ended October 31, 2021. The intrinsic value of options exercised in the nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 875.0 million and $ 3.8 billion, respectively. The aggregate grant-date fair value of options that vested during the nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 60.7 million and $ 62.7 million, respectively.  RSUs &#8212;RSUs granted prior to the IPO had both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions, of which the performance-based vesting condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness of the IPO in September 2020. The service-based vesting condition for these awards is typically satisfied over four years with a cliff vesting period of one year and continued vesting quarterly thereafter. Stock-based compensation associated with RSUs granted prior to the IPO was recognized using an accelerated attribution method from the time it was deemed probable that the vesting condition was met through the time the service-based vesting condition had been achieved. RSUs granted after the IPO only contain the service-based vesting condition and the related stock-based compensation for such RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  During the nine months ended October 31, 2022, the Company began funding withholding taxes due upon the vesting of employee RSUs in certain jurisdictions by net share settlement, rather than its previous approach of selling shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The amount of withholding taxes related to net share settlement of employee RSUs is reflected as (i) a reduction to additional paid-in-capital, and (ii) cash outflows for financing activities when the payments are made. The shares withheld by the Company as a result of the net share settlement of RSUs are not considered issued and outstanding, and do not impact the calculation of basic net income (loss) per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders.  A summary of RSU activity during the nine months ended October 31, 2022 is as follows:  Number of Shares (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share  Unvested Balance&#8212;January 31, 2022  9,612 &#160; $ 180.08 &#160; Granted 5,763 &#160; $ 201.89 &#160; Vested ( 848 ) $ 161.90 &#160; Forfeited ( 327 ) $ 202.80 &#160; Unvested Balance&#8212;April 30, 2022  14,200 &#160; $ 189.50 &#160; Granted 1,374 &#160; $ 145.19 &#160; Vested ( 775 ) $ 156.97 &#160; Forfeited ( 462 ) $ 196.87 &#160; Unvested Balance&#8212;July 31, 2022  14,337 &#160; $ 186.77 &#160; Granted 2,361 &#160; $ 172.86 &#160; Vested ( 786 ) $ 165.42 &#160; Forfeited ( 351 ) $ 218.21 &#160;  Unvested Balance&#8212;October 31, 2022  15,561 &#160; $ 185.03 &#160;  Early Exercised Stock Options &#8212;Common stock purchased pursuant to an early exercise of stock options is not deemed to be outstanding for accounting purposes until those shares vest. The consideration received for an exercise of an option is considered to be a deposit of the exercise price and the related dollar amount is recorded in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The shares issued upon the early exercise of these unvested stock option awards, which are reflected as exercises in the stock option activity table above, are considered to be legally issued and outstanding on the date of exercise. Upon termination of service, the Company may repurchase unvested shares acquired through the early exercise of stock options at a price equal to the price per share paid upon the exercise of such options. As of October 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022, shares subject to repurchase as a result of early exercised options were not material.  Restricted Common Stock &#8212;Restricted common stock is not deemed to be outstanding for accounting purposes until it vests.  As discussed in Note 7, during the nine months ended October 31, 2022, in connection with the Streamlit business combination, the Company issued to Streamlit&#8217;s three founders a total of 0.4 million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock outside of the Plans in exchange for a portion of their Streamlit stock. These shares are subject to vesting agreements pursuant to which the shares will vest over three years , subject to each founder&#8217;s continued employment with the Company or its affiliates. The $ 93.7 million fair value of these shares are accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation over the requisite service period of three years . As of October 31, 2022, all 0.4 million shares remained unvested.  A summary of restricted common stock activity during the nine months ended October 31, 2022 is as follows:  Outside of the Plans Number of Shares (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share  Unvested Balance&#8212;January 31, 2022  380 &#160; $ 2.11 &#160; Granted 409 &#160; $ 229.13 &#160; Vested ( 90 ) $ 2.10 &#160;  Unvested Balance&#8212;April 30, 2022  699 &#160; $ 134.99 &#160; Vested ( 90 ) $ 2.10 &#160; Unvested Balance&#8212;July 31, 2022  609 &#160; $ 154.73 &#160; Vested ( 91 ) $ 2.10 &#160;  Unvested Balance&#8212;October 31, 2022  518 &#160; $ 181.37 &#160;  Stock-Based Compensation &#8212; The following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted to employees during the nine months ended October 31, 2022:
