Nine Months Ended October 31, 2022 Expected term (in years) 6.0 Expected volatility 50.0 &#160; % Risk-free interest rate 1.8 &#160; % Expected dividend yield &#8212; &#160; %  No stock options were granted during the three months ended October 31, 2022 or each of the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021.  Expected term &#8212;For stock options considered to be &#8220;plain vanilla&#8221; options, the Company estimates the expected term based on the simplified method, which is essentially the weighted average of the vesting period and contractual term, as the Company&#8217;s historical option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term.  Expected volatility &#8212;Prior to fiscal 2023, the Company performed an analysis of using the average volatility of a peer group of representative public companies with sufficient trading history over the expected term to develop an expected volatility assumption. During the nine months ended October 31, 2022, the Company began using the average volatility of its Class A common stock and the stocks of a peer group of representative public companies to develop an expected volatility assumption.  Risk-free interest rate &#8212;Risk-free rate is estimated based upon quoted market yields for the United States Treasury debt securities for a term consistent with the expected life of the awards in effect at the time of grant.  Expected dividend yield &#8212;Because the Company has never paid and has no intention to pay cash dividends on common stock, the expected dividend yield is zero .  Fair value of underlying common stock &#8212;Since the completion of the IPO, the fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock is determined by the closing price, on the date of grant, of its common stock, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  The following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of employee stock purchase rights granted under the 2020 ESPP during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021:  Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Expected term (in years) 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 Expected volatility 74.8 &#160; % 37.3 &#160; % 58.9 % - 74.8 %  37.3 % - 49.5 %  Risk-free interest rate 3.8 &#160; % 0.1 &#160; % 0.9 % - 3.8 %  0.1 &#160; % Expected dividend yield &#8212; &#160; % &#8212; &#160; % &#8212; &#160; % &#8212; &#160; %  Stock-based compensation included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations was as follows (in thousands):  Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Cost of revenue $ 27,794 &#160; $ 21,163 &#160; $ 76,499 &#160; $ 66,380 &#160; Sales and marketing 65,010 &#160; 43,074 &#160; 177,641 &#160; 141,463 &#160; Research and development 110,231 &#160; 56,142 &#160; 280,721 &#160; 174,788 &#160; General and administrative 26,128 &#160; 24,008 &#160; 75,976 &#160; 76,761 &#160; Stock-based compensation, net of amounts capitalized 229,163 &#160; 144,387 &#160; 610,837 &#160; 459,392 &#160; Capitalized stock-based compensation 7,792 &#160; 6,085 &#160; 21,002 &#160; 19,322 &#160; Total stock-based compensation $ 236,955 &#160; $ 150,472 &#160; $ 631,839 &#160; $ 478,714 &#160;  As of October 31, 2022, total compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards not yet recognized was $ 2.5 billion, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years.  11. Income Taxes  The Company computes its tax provision for interim periods by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date pre-tax income from recurring operations and adjusting for discrete tax items arising in that quarter.  The Company had an effective tax rate of ( 2.0 %) and 3.1 % for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, and ( 0.8 %) and ( 0.3 %) for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively. The Company has incurred U.S. operating losses and has minimal profits in foreign jurisdictions.  The Company has evaluated all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income and expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income, and has determined that it is more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the United States and the United Kingdom. Due to uncertainties surrounding the realization of the deferred tax assets, the Company maintains a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets.  The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. As of October 31, 2022, tax years 2012 and forward generally remain open for examination for U.S. federal and state tax purposes, and tax years 2017 and forward generally remain open for examination for foreign tax purposes.  The Company has applied ASC 740 and determined that it has uncertain tax positions giving rise to unrecognized tax benefits for each of the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company&#8217;s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months. None of the unrecognized tax benefits are currently expected to impact the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate, if realized, as a result of the full valuation allowance.  On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Inflation Act) into law. The Inflation Act contains certain tax measures, including a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on some large corporations and an excise tax of 1% on corporate stock buy-backs. The Company is currently evaluating the various provisions of the Inflation Act and does not anticipate the impact, if any, will be material to the Company.  12. Net Loss per Share  Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders is computed in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities. The Company considers unvested common stock to be participating securities, as the holders of such stock have the right to receive nonforfeitable dividends on a pari passu basis in the event that a dividend is declared on common stock.  Basic net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders is computed by dividing net loss attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Snowflake Inc. common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive Snowflake Inc. common stock equivalents to the extent they are dilutive. For purposes of this calculation, stock options, RSUs, restricted common stock, early exercised stock options, and employee stock purchase rights under the 2020 ESPP are considered to be common stock equivalents but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders as their effect is anti-dilutive for all periods presented.  As discussed above in Note 10, on March 1, 2021, all 169.5 million shares of the Company's then-outstanding Class B common stock, par value $ 0.0001 per share, were automatically converted into the same number of shares of Class A common stock, par value $ 0.0001 per share, pursuant to the terms of the Company&#8217;s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. No additional shares of Class B common stock will be issued following such conversion. In addition, on March 3, 2021, the Company filed a certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware effecting the retirement of the shares of Class B common stock that were issued but no longer outstanding following the conversion. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Class A and Class B common stock were identical prior to the conversion, except with respect to voting, converting, and transfer rights. As the liquidation and dividend rights were identical, the undistributed earnings were allocated on a proportionate basis to each class of common stock, and the resulting basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders were, therefore, the same for both Class A and Class B common stock on both an individual and a combined basis.  The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders (in thousands, except per share data):  Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Numerator: Net loss $ ( 201,442 ) $ ( 154,856 ) $ ( 590,042 ) $ ( 547,795 ) Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest ( 506 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 506 ) &#8212; &#160; Net loss attributable to Snowflake Inc.
