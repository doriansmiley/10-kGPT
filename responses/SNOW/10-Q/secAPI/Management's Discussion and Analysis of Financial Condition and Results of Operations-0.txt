 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with (1) our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and (2) our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the discussion under the heading &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 30, 2022. This discussion, particularly information with respect to our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as described under the heading &#8220;Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should review the disclosure under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.  In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is included in the section titled &#8220;Key Business Metrics.&#8221; This non-GAAP financial measure is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our supplemental non-GAAP information and the GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliation included in the section titled &#8220;Key Business Metrics&#8212;Free Cash Flow,&#8221; to more fully understand our business.  Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to &#8220;Snowflake,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or similar terms refer to Snowflake Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  Overview  We believe in a data connected world where organizations have seamless access to explore, share, and unlock the value of data. To realize this vision, we deliver the Data Cloud, a network where Snowflake customers, partners, data providers, and data consumers can break down data silos and derive value from rapidly growing data sets in secure, governed, and compliant ways.  Our platform is the innovative technology that powers the Data Cloud, enabling customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful business insights, build data-driven applications, and share data. We provide our platform through a customer-centric, consumption-based business model, only charging customers for the resources they use.  Our cloud-native architecture consists of three independently scalable but logically integrated layers across storage, compute, and cloud services. The storage layer ingests massive amounts and varieties of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data to create a unified data record. The compute layer provides dedicated resources to enable users to simultaneously access common data sets for many use cases with minimal latency. The cloud services layer intelligently optimizes each use case&#8217;s performance requirements with no administration. This architecture is built on three major public clouds across 37 regional deployments around the world. These deployments are generally interconnected to deliver the Data Cloud, enabling a consistent, global user experience.  We generate the substantial majority of our revenue from fees charged to our customers based on the storage, compute, and data transfer resources consumed on our platform as a single, integrated offering. For storage resources, consumption fees are based on the average terabytes per month of all of the customer&#8217;s data stored in our platform. For compute resources, consumption fees are based on the type of compute resource used and the duration of use or, for some features, the volume of data processed. For data transfer resources, consumption fees are based on terabytes of data transferred, the public cloud provider used, and the region to and from which the transfer is executed.  Our customers typically enter into capacity arrangements with a term of one to four years, or consume our platform under on-demand arrangements in which we charge for use of our platform monthly in arrears. Consumption for most customers accelerates from the beginning of their usage to the end of their contract terms and often exceeds their initial capacity commitment amounts. When this occurs, our customers have the option to amend their existing agreement with us to purchase additional capacity or request early renewals. When a customer&#8217;s consumption during the contract term does not exceed its capacity commitment amount, it may have the option to roll over any unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity. For these reasons, we believe our deferred revenue is not a meaningful indicator of future revenue that will be recognized in any given time period.  Our go-to-market strategy is focused on acquiring new customers and driving continued use of our platform for existing customers. We primarily focus our selling efforts on large organizations and primarily sell our platform through a direct sales force, which targets technical and business leaders who are adopting a cloud strategy and leveraging data to improve their business performance. Our sales force is comprised of sales development, inside sales, and field sales personnel and is segmented by the industry, size, and region of prospective customers. Once our platform has been adopted, we focus on increasing the migration of additional customer workloads to our platform to drive increased consumption, as evidenced by our net revenue retention rate of 165% and 177% as of October 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022, respectively. See the section titled &#8220;Key Business Metrics&#8221; for a definition of net revenue retention rate.  Our platform is used globally by organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries. As of October 31, 2022, we had 7,292 total customers, increasing from 5,966 customers as of January 31, 2022. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our total customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments. Our platform has been adopted by many of the world&#8217;s largest organizations that view Snowflake as a key strategic partner in their cloud and data transformation initiatives. As of October 31, 2022, our customers included 543 of the Forbes Global 2000, based on the 2022 Forbes Global 2000 list, and those customers contributed approximately 41% of our revenue for the nine months ended October 31, 2022. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is subject to adjustments for annual updates to the Global 2000 list by Forbes, as well as acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity with respect to such customers, and we present our Forbes Global 2000 customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments.  Business Combinations  On September 23, 2022, we acquired all outstanding stock of Applica Sp. z.o.o. (Applica), a privately-held company which provides an artificial intelligence platform for document understanding, for $174.7 million in cash.  On March 31, 2022, we acquired all outstanding stock of Streamlit, Inc. (Streamlit), a privately-held company which provides an open-source framework for creating and deploying data applications. The acquisition date fair value of the purchase consideration was $650.8 million, which was comprised of $211.8 million in cash and 1.9 million shares of our Class A common stock valued at $438.9 million as of the acquisition date. In addition, we issued to Streamlit&#8217;s three founders a total of 0.4 million shares of our Class A common stock in exchange for a portion of their Streamlit stock. These shares are subject to vesting agreements pursuant to which the shares will vest over three years, subject to each founder&#8217;s continued employment with us. The $93.7 million fair value of these shares are accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation over the requisite service period of three years.  The results of operations of these business combinations have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. See Note 7, &#8220;Business Combinations, Intangible Assets, and Goodwill,&#8221; to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details regarding these business combinations.  Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions and COVID-19  Our business and financial condition have been, and may continue to be, impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions, including higher inflation, higher interest rates, and fluctuations or volatility in capital markets or foreign currency exchange rates, which are causing customers to optimize consumption, rationalize budgets, and prioritize cash flow management.  In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused general business disruption worldwide beginning in January 2020. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, including any new variants, may continue to directly or indirectly impact general market conditions or our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition remains uncertain. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we required virtually all of our employees to work remotely and we canceled certain of our marketing events or adjusted those events to be virtual or include both an in-person and virtual experience. As our offices reopen and we resume in-person events, we expect to continue to incur incremental expenses in connection with onsite services, incur related in-office and event costs, and manage fluctuating in-person regulations and restrictions.
