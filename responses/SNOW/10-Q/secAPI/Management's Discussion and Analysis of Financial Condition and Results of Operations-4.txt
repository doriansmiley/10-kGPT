RSUs granted prior to our IPO have both a service-based and a performance-based vesting condition and, as a result, we recognized stock-based compensation associated with such RSUs using an accelerated attribution method.  As of October 31, 2022, total compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards not yet recognized was $2.5 billion, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years.

We had 287 customers with product revenue of greater than $1 million for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2022, an increase from 148 customers as of October 31, 2021. Such customers represented approximately 61% and 53% of our product revenue for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Within these customers, we had 49 and 13 customers with product revenue of greater than $5 million and $10 million, respectively, for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2022. For each of the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 97% of our revenue was derived from existing customers under capacity arrangements, and less than 1% of our revenue was derived from new customers under capacity arrangements. For the nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 97% and 95% of our revenue was derived from existing customers under capacity arrangements, respectively, and approximately 1% and 3% of our revenue was derived from new customers under capacity arrangements, respectively. The remainder was driven by on-demand arrangements. The preceding historical metrics reflect any adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. For purposes of determining revenue derived from (i) customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million, (ii) new customers, and (iii) existing customers, we treat each customer account, including accounts for end-customers under a reseller arrangement, that has at least one corresponding capacity contract as a unique customer, and a single organization with multiple divisions, segments, or subsidiaries may be counted as multiple customers.  Professional services and other revenue increased $12.3 million and $38.6 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, as we continued to expand our professional services organization to help our customers further realize the benefits of our platform.  Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit (Loss), and Gross Margin  Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, 2022 2021 % Change 2022 2021 % Change (dollars in thousands) (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenue: Product $ 145,929 $ 92,292 58% $ 388,946 $ 245,420 58% Professional services and other 44,792 28,494 57% 122,937 78,833 56% Total cost of revenue $ 190,721 $ 120,786 58% $ 511,883 $ 324,253 58% Gross profit (loss): Product $ 376,823 $ 220,166 71% $ 994,508 $ 535,491 86% Professional services and other (10,516) (6,511) 62% (29,744) (24,191) 23% Total gross profit $ 366,307 $ 213,655 71% $ 964,764 $ 511,300 89% Gross margin: Product 72% 70% 72% 69% Professional services and other (31%) (30%) (32%) (44%) Total gross margin 66% 64% 65% 61% Headcount (at period end) Product 343 226 343 226 Professional services and other 458 297 458 297 Total headcount 801 523 801 523  Cost of product revenue increased $53.6 million and $143.5 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, compared to the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $41.7 million and $116.9 million in third-party cloud infrastructure expenses as a result of increased customer consumption for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs also increased $7.7 million and $18.4 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, as a result of increased headcount and overall costs to support the growth in our business, and increased stock-based compensation primarily related to additional equity awards granted to current and new employees. The remaining increase of $2.4 million and $4.4 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, was primarily driven by increased amortization of internal-use software development costs.  Our product gross margin was 72% for each of the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, compared to 70% and 69% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, which increase was primarily due to (i) an increased percentage of revenue from consumption of higher-priced editions of our platform, (ii) increased scale across our cloud infrastructure regions, and (iii) higher volume-based discounts for our purchases of third-party cloud infrastructure. While we expect our product gross margin to remain relatively flat for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023, a number of factors could negatively impact our product gross margin, including (i) fluctuations in the mix and timing of customers&#8217; consumption, which is inherently variable at our customers&#8217; discretion, (ii) whether or not a customer contracts with us through our marketplace listings, (iii) our discounting practices, including as a result of changes to the competitive environment, and (iv) the extent of our investments in our operations, including performance improvements that may make our platform or the underlying cloud infrastructure more efficient.
