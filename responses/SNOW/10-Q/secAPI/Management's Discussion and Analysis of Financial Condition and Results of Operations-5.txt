Cost of professional services and other revenue increased $16.3 million and $44.1 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, compared to the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $13.1 million and $35.6 million in personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, as a result of increased headcount and overall costs to support the growth in our business, and increased stock-based compensation primarily related to additional equity awards granted to current and new employees. Costs associated with contracted third-party partners also increased $2.9 million and $7.4 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, as a result of growth in our business.  Professional services and other gross margin improved for the nine months ended October 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to decreased stock-based compensation as a percentage of professional services and other revenue. We do not believe the year-over-year changes in professional services and other gross margins are meaningful given that we are continuing to scale our professional services organization and our professional services and other revenue represents a small percentage of our revenue.

The increase was primarily due to an increase of $63.3 million and $161.2 million in personnel-related costs (excluding commission expenses) and allocated overhead costs for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, as a result of increased headcount and overall costs to support the growth in our business, and increased stock-based compensation primarily related to additional equity awards granted to current and new employees, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation related to RSUs granted prior to our IPO. Expenses associated with sales commissions and draws paid to our sales force and certain referral fees paid to third parties, including amortization of deferred commissions, also increased $6.9 million and $26.6 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to increases in customers&#8217; consumption of our platform and in the annualized contract value of our customer contracts.  Advertising costs and other expenses associated with our marketing and business development programs also increased $6.2 million and $30.6 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by increased expenses related to in-person marketing events and user conferences, net of the associated proceeds. Expenses associated with Summit, our in-person annual user conference which was held virtually in the prior year due to the COVID-19 pandemic increased $10.5 million, net of the associated proceeds, for the nine months ended October 31, 2022, compared to the same period in the prior year. As a result of in-person marketing events and user conferences as well as the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions, travel-related expenses also increased $6.4 million and $14.4 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.  In addition, sales and marketing expenses for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 included $7.6 million and $17.7 million of amortization of acquired developer community intangible asset, respectively, as a result of the Streamlit business combination completed in March 2022. The remaining increase in sales and marketing expenses was attributable to increased software and subscription services dedicated for use by our sales and marketing organizations.

The increase was primarily due to an increase of $84.1 million and $173.9 million in personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, as a result of increased stock-based compensation, headcount, and overall costs to support the growth in our business. The increase in personnel-related costs included a $54.1 million and $105.9 million increase in stock-based compensation for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, primarily related to additional equity awards granted to current and new employees and the post-combination stock-based compensation related to the Streamlit business combination, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation related to RSUs granted prior to our IPO. See Note 10, &#8220;Equity,&#8221; to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details.  The remaining increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by an increase of $6.0 million and $16.0 million in third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in developing our platform for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.  General and Administrative  Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, 2022 2021 % Change 2022 2021 % Change (dollars in thousands) (dollars in thousands) General and administrative $ 76,462 $ 64,055 19% $ 218,314 $ 189,846 15% Percentage of revenue 14 % 19 % 15 % 23 % Headcount (at period end) 886 657 886 657  General and administrative expenses increased $12.4 million and $28.5 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, compared to the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively. The increase was partially due to an increase of $3.1 million and $6.3 million in personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, as a result of increased headcount and overall costs to support the growth in our business.  Outside services also increased $4.8 million and $7.7 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to increased legal fees related to acquisitions. In addition, unallocated lease costs, which are associated with unused office facilities to accommodate planned headcount growth, increased $1.1 million and $4.4 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The remaining increase in general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 was attributable to increased insurance expenses and other corporate expenses to support the normal course of operations and our continued growth.
