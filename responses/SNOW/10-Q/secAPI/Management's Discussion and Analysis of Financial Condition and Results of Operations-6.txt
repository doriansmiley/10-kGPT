Our provision for income taxes was $4.0 million for the three months ended October 31, 2022, compared to $1.2 million for the three months ended October 31, 2021, primarily due to higher pre-tax income in foreign jurisdictions.  Our benefit from income taxes was $18.8 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2022, compared to our provision for income taxes of $1.4 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2021, primarily due to the partial release of a valuation allowance of $26.7 million as a result of the Streamlit business combination.  We maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets, and the significant components of our recorded tax expense are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction&#8217;s individual tax rates, laws on the timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Our effective tax rate might fluctuate significantly and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than forecasted in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than forecasted in countries that have higher statutory rates.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of October 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments totaling $4.9 billion. Our investments primarily consist of corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, money market funds, and certificates of deposit.  As of October 31, 2022, our RPO was $3.0 billion. Our RPO represents the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized, including (i) deferred revenue and (ii) non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, which are not recorded on the balance sheet. Portions of RPO that are not yet invoiced and are denominated in foreign currencies are revalued into U.S. dollars each period based on the applicable period-end exchange rates.  Our primary source of cash is payments received from our customers. Our primary uses of cash include personnel-related expenses, sales and marketing expenses, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses, overhead costs, capital expenditures, and acquisitions and strategic investments we may make from time to time. As of October 31, 2022, our material cash requirements from known contractual obligations and commitments relate primarily to (i) third-party cloud infrastructure agreements, (ii) operating leases for office facilities, and (iii) subscription arrangements used to facilitate our operations at the enterprise level. For the nine months ended October 31, 2022, there were no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business in our commitments and contractual obligations disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on March 30, 2022. See Note 9, &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies,&#8221; to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details.  On March 31, 2022, we acquired all outstanding stock of Streamlit. A portion of the purchase consideration was paid in cash, which amounted to $177.9 million, net of $33.9 million cash and cash equivalents acquired.  In May 2022, we entered into an agreement related to the expansion and lease term extension of an existing office facility located in the United States, which is considered a lease modification not accounted for as a separate contract. The modified lease commenced during the nine months ended October 31, 2022, with an expiration date in fiscal 2035. Total commitment, net of tenant incentives expected to be received, under the modified lease is $68.0 million.  On September 23, 2022, we acquired all outstanding stock of Applica for $174.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired.  During the nine months ended October 31, 2022, we began funding withholding taxes due upon the vesting of employee RSUs in certain jurisdictions by net share settlement, rather than our previous approach of selling shares of our common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards. The amount of withholding taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee RSUs was $51.7 million and $135.8 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively.  On November 25, 2022 (the Agreement Date), we entered into an agreement to acquire all outstanding stock of a privately-held company for approximately $75 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The acquisition is expected to close within six months of the Agreement Date, subject to certain closing conditions.  We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments will be sufficient to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. For the period beyond the next 12 months, we believe we will be able to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs from our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments and cash flows from our operating activities. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, expenditures related to our headcount growth, the timing and the amount of cash received from customers, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the price at which we are able to purchase public cloud capacity, expenses associated with our international expansion, the introduction of platform enhancements, and the continuing market adoption of our platform. We may continue to enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, and technologies. We may, as a result of those arrangements or the general expansion of our business, be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):  Nine Months Ended October 31, 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 328,323 $ 31,281 Net cash used in investing activities $ (533,101) $ (56,967) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (52,540) $ 142,671  Operating Activities  Net cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, primarily consisting of (i) stock-based compensation, net of amounts capitalized, (ii) net unrealized gains or losses on strategic investments in equity securities, (iii) depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and amortization of acquired intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred commissions, (v) amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets, (vi) net amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts on investments, and (vii) deferred income tax benefit or expense, and changes in operating assets and liabilities during each period.  For the nine months ended October 31, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $328.3 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $590.0 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $762.6 million, and net cash inflows of $155.8 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of the effects of business combinations. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities during the nine months ended October 31, 2022 were (i) a $150.7 million decrease in accounts receivable due to timing of billings and collections as we have historically received a higher volume of customer orders in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, (ii) a $46.7 million increase in deferred revenue mainly due to invoicing for prepaid capacity agreements outpacing revenue recognition, (iii) a $27.7 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to the timing of accruals and payments, and (iv) a $13.2 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to the timing of prepayments for software and subscriptions services and third-party cloud infrastructure expenses, partially offset by (a) a $63.6 million increase in deferred commissions earned upon the origination of customer contracts, and (b) a $29.2 million decrease in operating lease liabilities due to payments related to our operating lease obligations.  For the nine months ended October 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $31.3 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $547.8 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $558.7 million, and net cash inflows of $20.4 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities.  Net cash provided by operating activities increased $297.0 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2022, compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase of $787.8 million in cash collected from customers resulting from increased sales. This was partially offset by increased expenditures due to an increase in headcount and growth in our business. We expect to continue to generate positive net cash flows from operating activities for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023.
