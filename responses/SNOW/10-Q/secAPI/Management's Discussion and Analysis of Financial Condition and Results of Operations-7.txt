Critical Accounting Estimates  Our management&#8217;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. By their nature, these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.  Except for the following, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to those described in the section titled &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on March 30, 2022.  Business Combinations  See Note 2, &#8220;Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on March 30, 2022, for information regarding our significant accounting policies over business combinations.  When we acquire a business, we allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated respective fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, time and resources required to recreate the assets acquired. These estimates are based on information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, our assessment of the information, and historical experience. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. The amounts and estimated useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired in business combinations impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.
