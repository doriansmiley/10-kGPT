&#8226; fluctuations in demand for our platform or changes in our pricing model;  &#8226; fluctuations in usage of our platform, including as a result of customer optimization efforts that result in reduced consumption to execute workloads;  &#8226; our ability to attract new customers;  &#8226; our ability to retain existing customers;  &#8226; customer expansion rates;  &#8226; timing, amount, and cost of our investments to expand the capacity of our public cloud providers;  &#8226; seasonality;  &#8226; investments in new features and functionality, including investments in making our platform available to store and process highly regulated data;  &#8226; fluctuations in consumption resulting from the introduction of new features, technologies, or capabilities to our software, systems, or to underlying cloud infrastructure, including features or capabilities that may increase or decrease the consumption required to execute existing or future workloads, like better storage compression and cloud infrastructure processor improvements;  &#8226; the timing of purchases;  &#8226; the speed with which customers are able to migrate data onto our platform;  &#8226; fluctuations or delays in purchasing decisions in anticipation of new products or enhancements by us or our competitors;  &#8226; changes in customers&#8217; budgets and in the timing of their budget cycles and purchasing decisions;  &#8226; our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;  &#8226; the amount and timing of operating expenses, particularly research and development and sales and marketing expenses, including commissions;  &#8226; the amount and timing of non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation, goodwill impairments, and other non-cash charges;  &#8226; the amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training, and integrating new employees and retaining and motivating existing employees;  &#8226; the effects and timing of acquisitions and their integration;  &#8226; general political, social, and economic conditions, uncertainty, or volatility, both domestically and internationally, as well as political, social, and economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers and partners participate;  &#8226; health epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;  &#8226; the impact, or timing of our adoption, of new accounting pronouncements;  &#8226; changes in regulatory or legal environments that may cause us to incur, among other things, expenses associated with compliance;  &#8226; the overall tax rate for our business, which may be affected by the mix of income we earn in the United States and in jurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects of stock-based compensation, and the effects of changes in our business;  &#8226; the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period in which such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period;  &#8226; rising inflation and our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;  &#8226; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated or measured in foreign currencies;  &#8226; fluctuations or impairments in the market values of our portfolio or strategic investments, or in interest rates;  &#8226; changes in the competitive dynamics of our market, including consolidation among competitors or customers; and  &#8226; significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our platform.  Any of these and other factors, or the cumulative effect of some of these factors, may cause our results of operations to vary significantly or be adversely affected. If our results of operations fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our common stock could decline substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class actions.  Failure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and platform.  We must expand our sales and marketing organization to increase our sales to new and existing customers. We plan to continue expanding our direct sales force, both domestically and internationally, particularly our direct enterprise sales organization focused on sales to the world&#8217;s largest organizations. It may require significant time and resources to effectively onboard new sales and marketing personnel, and continued or increased remote working conditions could result in less effective, more operationally complicated, or lengthier onboarding processes. We also plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs that are industry-specific and focused on large organizations. Once a new customer begins using our platform, our sales team will need to continue to focus on expanding consumption with that customer. All of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources, including in industries and sales channels in which we have limited experience to date. Our business and results of operations will be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts generate increases in revenue that are smaller than anticipated. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate, and retain talented and effective sales personnel, if our new and existing sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective.  Sales efforts to large customers involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with respect to sales to smaller organizations.  Sales to large customers involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smaller organizations, such as longer sales cycles, more complex customer requirements, including our ability to partner with third-parties that advise such customers or help them integrate their IT solutions, substantial upfront sales costs, and less predictability in completing some of our sales. For example, large customers may require considerable time to evaluate and test our platform prior to making a purchase decision and placing an order. In addition, large customers may be switching from legacy on-premises solutions when purchasing our products, and may rely on third-parties with whom we do not have relationships when making purchasing decisions. A number of factors also influence the length and variability of our sales cycle, including the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our platform, the discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles, and the competitive nature of evaluation and purchasing approval processes. As a result, the length of our sales cycle, from identification of the opportunity to deal closure, may vary significantly from customer to customer, with sales to large enterprises typically taking longer to complete. Moreover, large customers often begin to deploy our products on a limited basis but nevertheless demand implementation services and negotiate pricing discounts, which increase our upfront investment in the sales effort with no guarantee that sales to these customers will justify our substantial upfront investment. If we fail to effectively manage these risks associated with sales cycles and sales to large customers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be affected.  Unfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy, or reductions in cloud spending, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations.  Our results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers and potential customers. Negative conditions or volatility in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, international trade relations, inflation, and interest rate fluctuations, or the existence of pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), political turmoil, natural catastrophes, warfare, or terrorist attacks on the United States, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, Japan, or elsewhere, could cause a decrease in business investments, including spending on cloud technologies, and negatively affect the growth of our business. For example, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has created volatility in the global capital markets and could have further global economic consequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain. In addition, unfavorable conditions in the general economy may negatively impact our customers&#8217; budgets or cash flow, which could impact the contract terms, including payment terms, our customers demand from us. Competitors, many of whom are larger and have greater financial resources than we do, may respond to challenging market conditions by lowering prices in an attempt to attract our customers. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown, instability, or recovery, generally or within any particular industry.  Our growth depends on the development, expansion, and success of our partner relationships.  As part of our vision for the Data Cloud, we will need to grow and maintain a network of data providers, data consumers, and data application developers. The relationships we have with these partners, and that our partners have with our customers, provide our customers with enhanced value from our platform and the Data Cloud, including Snowflake Marketplace. Our future growth will be increasingly dependent on the success of these relationships, and if we are unsuccessful in growing and maintaining these relationships or the types and quality of data supported by or available for consumption on our platform, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
