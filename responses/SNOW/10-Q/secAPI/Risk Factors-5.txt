A pandemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic or its resurgence, could have an adverse impact on our business, operations, and the markets and communities in which we, our partners, and customers operate.  The potential long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, its resurgence, or a new pandemic on the global economy and our business continue to be difficult to assess or predict. Potential impacts include:  &#8226; Our prospective and existing customers may experience, or may continue to experience, slowdowns in their businesses, which in turn may result in reduced demand for our platform, lengthening of sales cycles, loss of customers, and difficulties in collections.  &#8226; Our vendors and suppliers may experience, or may continue to experience, disruptions in their supply chains, which may result in service interruptions or additional operating expenses, and may increase the price at which our vendors and suppliers are willing to sell their products to us.  &#8226; Our return to work and remote working policies, which continue to evolve, may decrease employee productivity, collaboration, and morale, and may increase unwanted employee attrition.  &#8226; We continue to incur fixed costs, particularly for real estate, and may derive reduced benefit from those costs.  &#8226; We may continue to experience disruptions to our growth planning, such as for facilities and international expansion.  &#8226; We are incurring costs in returning to work from our facilities around the world, including changes to the workplace, such as space planning, food service, and amenities, as well as costs associated with complying with new or evolving regulatory requirements, which may vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction.  &#8226; We are subject to an uncertain regulatory environment, and are required to comply with cumbersome and conflicting federal, state, and local laws regarding COVID-19, which may pose significant disruption to our business operations, require significant management attention to respond to and enforce, and result in an increased risk of non-compliance and claims.  &#8226; Our operating lease right-of-use assets may be impaired due to potential loss of sublease income.  &#8226; We may be subject to legal liability for safe workplace claims.  &#8226; Our critical vendors or partners could go out of business.  &#8226; Certain of our in-person marketing events have been canceled and we may experience or continue to experience (i) prolonged delays in our ability to reschedule or conduct in-person marketing events and other sales and marketing activities, or (ii) additional costs related to hosting in-person events that will be subject to uncertain and changing regulations and restrictions.  &#8226; Our marketing, sales, professional services, and support organizations are accustomed to extensive face-to-face customer and partner interactions, and conducting business virtually continues to pose challenges.  While many states and countries have reopened, the status of the global recovery remains uncertain and unpredictable. Business activity may not recover as quickly as anticipated, and widespread recovery will be impacted by future developments, including future pandemics or new variant strains, government and private sector requirements, and the emergence and effectiveness of medical and other measures. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Our current operations are international in scope, and we plan further geographic expansion, creating a variety of operational challenges.  A component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally. Customer accounts outside the United States generated 21% of our revenue for each of the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively. We are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets, but there is no guarantee that such efforts will have the desired effect. For example, we anticipate that we will need to establish relationships with new partners in order to expand into certain countries, and if we fail to identify, establish, and maintain such relationships, we may be unable to execute on our expansion plans. We expect that our international activities will continue to grow for the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in existing and new international markets, which will require significant dedication of management attention and financial resources.  Our current and future international business and operations involve a variety of risks, including:  &#8226; slower than anticipated public cloud adoption by international businesses;  &#8226; changes in a specific country&#8217;s or region&#8217;s political, economic, or legal and regulatory environment, including the effects of Brexit, pandemics, tariffs, trade wars, sanctions, or long-term environmental risks;  &#8226; the need to adapt and localize our platform for specific countries and the engineering and related costs that we may incur when making those changes;  &#8226; greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;  &#8226; unexpected changes in, or the selective application of, trade relations, regulations, or laws;  &#8226; new, evolving, and more stringent regulations relating to privacy and data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information;  &#8226; differing and potentially more onerous labor regulations where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including regulations governing terminations in locations that do not permit at-will employment and deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations;  &#8226; challenges inherent in efficiently managing, and the increased costs associated with, an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits, and compliance programs that are specific to each jurisdiction;  &#8226; difficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, and regulatory systems;  &#8226; increased travel, real estate, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with international operations, including increased costs associated with changing and potentially conflicting environmental regulations and requirements;  &#8226; currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue, RPO, and expenses, and the cost and risk of utilizing mitigating derivative transactions and entering into hedging transactions to the extent we do so in the future;  &#8226; limitations on, or charges or taxes associated with, our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;  &#8226; laws and business practices favoring local competitors or general market preferences for local vendors;  &#8226; limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties obtaining, maintaining, protecting, or enforcing our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks and patents;  &#8226; political instability, military conflict or war, or terrorist activities;  &#8226; COVID-19 or any other pandemics or epidemics that could result in decreased economic activity in certain markets; additional costs associated with travel, return to work, or other restrictions that are specific to certain markets; decreased use of our products and services; or decreased ability to import, export, or sell our products and services to existing or new customers in international markets;  &#8226; exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (FCPA), U.S. bribery laws, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions;  &#8226; burdens of complying with laws and regulations related to taxation; and  &#8226; regulations, adverse tax burdens, and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult or costly to repatriate earnings and cash.  We expect to invest substantial time and resources to further expand our international operations and, if we are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and results of operations will suffer.  We may require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.  We have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings, payments received from our customers, and more recently, proceeds from our IPO. We cannot be certain if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fully fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business, which may require us to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all, particularly during times of market volatility and general economic instability. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. If we incur debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to holders of common stock to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in the future will depend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future issuances of debt or equity securities. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of our common stock and diluting their interests.  We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations and our ability to invest and hold our cash.
