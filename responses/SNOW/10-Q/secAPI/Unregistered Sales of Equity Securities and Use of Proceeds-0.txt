 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  (a) Recent Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities  In connection with our acquisition of the outstanding capital stock of Streamlit, Inc. in March 2022, we agreed to issue 2.3 million shares of our common stock as consideration (Equity Consideration), all of which have been issued. A portion of the Equity Consideration that was issued to Streamlit&#8217;s founders (Founder Shares) are subject to vesting agreements pursuant to which the Founder Shares vest over three years, subject to each founder&#8217;s continued employment with Snowflake or its affiliates.  These issuances were made in reliance on one or more of the following exemptions or exclusions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act): Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.  (b) Use of Proceeds  On September 18, 2020, we closed our IPO of 32.2 million shares of our Class A common stock at an offering price of $120.00 per share, including 4.2 million shares pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters&#8217; option to purchase additional shares of our Class A common stock, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $3.7 billion, net of the underwriting discounts. All of the shares issued and sold in our IPO were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-248280), which was declared effective by the SEC on September 15, 2020. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our IPO from those disclosed in our final prospectus for our IPO dated as of September 15, 2020 and filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on September 16, 2020.
