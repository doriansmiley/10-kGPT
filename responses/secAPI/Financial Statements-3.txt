Litigation and Legal Proceedings  From time to time, third parties may assert patent infringement claims against the Company. In addition, from time to time, the Company may be subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights; employment claims; securities claims; investor  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  claims; corporate claims; class action claims; and general contract, tort, or other claims. The Company may from time to time also be subject to various legal or government claims, disputes, or investigations. Such matters may include, but not be limited to, claims, disputes, allegations, or investigations related to warranty; refund; breach of contract; breach, leak, or misuse of personal data or confidential information; employment; government procurement; intellectual property; government regulation or compliance (including but not limited to anti-corruption requirements, export or other trade controls, data privacy or data protection, cybersecurity requirements, or antitrust/competition law requirements); securities; investor; corporate; or other matters. The Company establishes an accrual for loss contingencies when the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable.  On December 14, 2017, members of KT4 Partners LLC (Managing Member Marc Abramowitz) and Sandra Martin Clark, as trustee for the Marc Abramowitz Irrevocable Trust Number 7 (together, &#8220;KT4 Plaintiffs&#8221;), filed an action in the Delaware Superior Court against the Company and Disruptive Technology Advisers LLC. The complaint alleges tortious interference with prospective economic advantage and civil conspiracy in connection with a potential sale of stock by the KT4 Plaintiffs to a third party. The KT4 Plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages, interest, fees, and costs. On June 27, 2022, the Company and the KT4 Plaintiffs entered into an agreement to settle the litigation and certain other matters. The Company has paid the amount of the settlement in full and has received the insurance reimbursement as of September 30, 2022.  On September 15, 2022, October 25, 2022, and November 4, 2022, putative securities class action complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, captioned Cupat v. Palantir Technologies Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:22-cv-02384, Allegheny County Employees&#8217; Retirement System v. Palantir Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-02805, and Shijun Liu, Individually and as Trustee of the Liu Family Trust 2019 v. Palantir Technologies Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-02893, respectively, naming the Company and certain current and former officers and directors as defendants. The suits allege false and misleading statements about our business and prospects, and purport to allege claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933. The Company disputes these claims and intends to defend these matters vigorously. Because the litigation is in early stages, the Company is unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters.  As of September 30, 2022, the Company was not aware of any currently pending legal matters or claims, individually or in the aggregate, that were expected to have a material adverse impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  Letters of Credit and Guarantees  The Company had irrevocable standby letters of credit and guarantees, including bank guarantees, outstanding in the amounts of $ 41.5 million and $ 76.2 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, which were fully collateralized. The Company is required to maintain these letters of credit and guarantees primarily in connection with operating lease agreements, certain customer contracts, and other guarantees and financing arrangements. As of September 30, 2022, these letters of credit and guarantees had expiration dates through August 31, 2031.  Warranties and Indemnification  The Company generally provides a warranty for its software products and services and a service level agreement (&#8220;SLA&#8221;) for the Company&#8217;s performance of software operations via its operations and maintenance (&#8220;O&#38;M&#8221;) services to its customers. The Company&#8217;s products are generally warranted to perform substantially as described in the associated product documentation during the subscription term or for a period of up to 90 days where the software is hosted by the customer, and the Company includes O&#38;M services as part of its subscription and license agreements to support this warranty and maintain the operability of the software. The Company&#8217;s services are generally warranted to be performed in a professional manner and by an adequate staff with knowledge about the products. In the event there is a failure of such warranties, the Company generally is obligated to correct the product or service to conform to the warranty provision, as set forth in the applicable SLA, or, if the Company is unable to do so, the customer is entitled to seek a refund of the purchase price of the product and service (generally prorated over the contract term). Due to the absence of historical warranty claims, the Company&#8217;s expectations of future claims related to products under warranty continue to be insignificant. The Company has not recorded warranty expense or related accruals as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.  The Company generally agrees to indemnify its customers against legal claims that the Company&#8217;s software products infringe certain third-party intellectual property rights and accounts for its indemnification obligations. In the event of such a claim, the Company is generally obligated to defend its customer against the claim and to either settle the claim at the Company&#8217;s expense or pay damages that the customer is legally required to pay to the third-party claimant. In addition, in the event of an infringement, the Company generally agrees to secure the right for the customer to continue using the infringing product; to modify or replace the infringing product; or, if those options are not commercially practicable, to refund the cost of the software, as prorated over the period. To date, the Company has not been required to make any payment resulting from infringement claims asserted against its customers and does not believe that the Company will be liable for such claims in the  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  foreseeable future. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for infringement costs as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.  The Company has obligations under certain circumstances to indemnify each of the defendant directors and certain officers against judgments, fines, settlements, and expenses related to claims against such directors and certain officers and otherwise to the fullest extent permitted under the law and the Company&#8217;s bylaws and Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.  8. Stockholders' Equity  The Company&#8217;s Class A, Class B, and Class F common stock (collectively, the &#8220;common stock&#8221;) all have the same rights, except with respect to voting and conversion rights. Class A and Class B common stock have voting rights of 1 and 10 votes per share, respectively. The Class F common stock has the voting rights generally described herein and each share of Class F common stock is convertible at any time, at the option of the holder thereof, into one share of Class B common stock.

The Class F common stock generally gives the Founders the ability to control up to 49.999999 % of the total voting power of the Company's capital stock, so long as the Founders and certain of their affiliates collectively meet a minimum ownership threshold, which was 100.0 million of the Company's equity securities as of September 30, 2022.  Holders of the common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if declared by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends.
