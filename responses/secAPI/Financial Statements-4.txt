Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  RSUs  The following table summarizes the RSU activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 (in thousands, except per share amounts):  RSUs Outstanding Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Balance as of December 31, 2021 153,749 &#160; $ 9.56 &#160; RSUs granted 19,686 &#160; 11.77 &#160; RSUs vested and converted to shares ( 35,849 ) 8.68 &#160; RSUs canceled ( 6,479 ) 9.32 &#160; Balance as of September 30, 2022 131,107 &#160; $ 10.15 &#160;  As of September 30, 2022, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the RSUs outstanding was $ 779.3 million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average service period of three years .  Stock-based Compensation Expense  Total stock-based compensation expense was as follows (in thousands):  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Cost of revenue $ 10,525 &#160; $ 14,860 &#160; $ 33,413 &#160; $ 54,866 &#160; Sales and marketing 48,824 &#160; 57,124 &#160; 147,501 &#160; 186,418 &#160; Research and development 25,113 &#160; 34,472 &#160; 76,996 &#160; 122,976 &#160; General and administrative 55,846 &#160; 78,379 &#160; 177,490 &#160; 247,048 &#160; Total stock-based compensation expense $ 140,308 &#160; $ 184,835 &#160; $ 435,400 &#160; $ 611,308 &#160;  10. Income Taxes  The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $ 1.1 million and $ 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and a provision for income taxes of $ 5.7 million and a benefit from income taxes of $ 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. as well as other tax jurisdictions in which it conducts business. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate as of September 30, 2022 differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign income taxed at different rates, foreign withholding taxes, and valuation allowances recorded on its losses from the U.S., United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;), and other jurisdictions . The provision for income taxes decreased by $ 0.3 million and increased by $ 6.8 million from a benefit from income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. These changes are primarily due to the absence in the current period of the revaluation of the Company&#8217;s U.K. deferred tax assets as a result of a change in the U.K. corporate tax rate enacted in June 2021.  The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in future periods. The Company assesses its ability to realize the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, and it establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company weighs all available positive and negative evidence, including its earnings history and results of recent operations, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. For example, due to the weight of objectively verifiable negative evidence, including its history of U.S. and U.K. net operating tax losses, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that its U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets will not be fully realized. Accordingly, the Company has maintained a full valuation allowance on its U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2022.  Provisions enacted in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental (&#8220;R&#38;E&#8221;) expenditures became effective on January 1, 2022. Beginning January 1, 2022, all U.S. and non-U.S. based R&#38;E expenditures must be capitalized and amortized over five and fifteen years, respectively. The U.S. Congress is considering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to future periods. However, there is no assurance that the provision will be deferred, repealed or otherwise modified. The effect of the requirement did not have a material impact on our income tax provision.  Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, implements a 15% minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations, a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. Based on the Company's current analysis of the provisions, the Company does not believe this legislation will have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  11. Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders  The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders (in thousands, except per share amounts):  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Numerator Net loss attributable to common stockholders, for diluted net loss per share $ ( 123,875 ) $ ( 102,137 ) $ ( 404,583 ) $ ( 364,191 ) Denominator Weighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share, basic 2,073,265 &#160; 1,964,395 &#160; 2,054,926 &#160; 1,893,911 &#160; Weighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share, diluted 2,073,265 &#160; 1,964,395 &#160; 2,054,926 &#160; 1,893,911 &#160; Net loss per share Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic $ ( 0.06 ) $ ( 0.05 ) $ ( 0.20 ) $ ( 0.19 ) Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, diluted $ ( 0.06 ) $ ( 0.05 ) $ ( 0.20 ) $ ( 0.19 )  The following outstanding potentially dilutive common stock equivalents have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods presented due to their anti-dilutive effect (in thousands):  As of September 30, 2022 2021 Options and stock appreciation rights issued and outstanding 331,121 &#160; 374,555 &#160; RSUs outstanding 128,182 &#160; 166,033 &#160; Warrants to purchase common stock 13,042 &#160; 13,042 &#160; Total 472,345 &#160; 553,630 &#160;  12. Segment and Geographic Information  The following reporting segment tables reflect the results of the Company&#8217;s reportable operating segments consistent with the manner in which the chief operating decision maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;) evaluates the performance of each segment and allocates the Company&#8217;s resources. The CODM does not evaluate the performance of the Company&#8217;s assets on a segment basis for internal management reporting and, therefore, such information is not presented.  Contribution is used, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, each of the segments. A segment&#8217;s contribution is calculated as segment revenue less the related costs of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. It excludes certain operating expenses that are not allocated to segments because they are separately managed at the consolidated corporate level. These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation expense, research and development expenses, and general and administrative expenses.  Palantir Technologies Inc.
