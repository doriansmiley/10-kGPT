 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible losses will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.  The results of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution in any legal proceedings could materially affect our future business, results of operations, or financial condition. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.  For information on legal proceedings, refer to Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies &#8212; Litigation and Legal Proceedings in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
