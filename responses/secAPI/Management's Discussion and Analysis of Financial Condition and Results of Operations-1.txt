Table of contents  We have also made a number of investments in companies whose businesses rely on the ability of their organizations to manage and analyze data effectively at scale.  Our proximity to these businesses and the industries in which they are operating has enhanced, and is expected to continue enhancing, our own product and business development efforts, as we continue expanding access to our platforms to the broadest possible set of customers.  Macroeconomic Trends  As a corporation with an international presence, we are subject to risks and uncertainties caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, inflationary pressures, and foreign currency fluctuations. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape.  COVID-19 Impact  As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to take precautionary measures in order to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate, which initially included the suspension of all non-essential business travel of employees and the temporary closure of all of our major offices. Although the majority of our workforce worked remotely, there was minimal disruption in our ability to ensure the effective operation of our software platforms. We have reopened our offices and are allowing business travel to resume, while continuing to closely monitor developments around the evolving nature of the pandemic, and some of our employees continue to work remotely.  The economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been challenging for certain of our customers and prospective customers. While the broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain, the COVID-19 pandemic has, to date, not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations. The economic effects of the pandemic and resulting societal changes are currently not predictable.  The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear to many of our customers that accommodating the extended timelines ordinarily required to realize results from implementing new software solutions is not an option during a crisis. As a result, customers are increasingly adopting our software, which can be ready in days, over internal software development efforts, which may take months or years.  We saw decreases in our travel and office-related expenditures, including during the temporary closures of our offices globally and reductions in related operating expenses, related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, our travel and office-related expenditures have increased, and may continue to increase moving forward.  Russian Invasion of Ukraine  We continue to closely monitor the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its global impacts on our business. While the conflict is still evolving and the outcome remains highly uncertain, we do not expect that the Russian invasion will have a material impact on our business and results of operations. We do not currently have office locations in Russia and none of our revenues came from sales to entities headquartered in Russia. In June 2022, our Chief Executive Officer, Alexander Karp, met with the President of Ukraine and other senior officials to discuss opening an office in Ukraine and providing ongoing support. Our current operations related to Ukraine are not material to our financial position or results of operations. However, if the conflict continues or worsens, leading to greater disruptions and uncertainty within the technology industry or global economy, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.  Foreign Currency Exchange Rates  Our contracts with customers are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling) had an unfavorable impact on our revenues from certain non-U.S. customers; however, that impact for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was not material to our financial position or results of operations.  See the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022, for further discussion of the impact of macroeconomic trends on our business.  Table of contents  Key Business Measure  In addition to the measures presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key non-GAAP business measure to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions.  Contribution Margin  We believe that the revenue we generate relative to the costs we incur in order to generate such revenue is an important measure of the efficiency of our business. We define contribution margin as revenue less our cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, divided by revenue.  Revenue is allocated to each customer account directly. The cost of revenue and sales and marketing costs include both the costs associated with the deployment and operation of our software as well as expenses associated with identifying new customers and expanding partnerships with existing ones.  Contribution margin, both across our business and on specific customer accounts, is intended to capture how much we have earned from customers after accounting for the costs associated with deploying and operating our software, as well as any sales and marketing expenses involved in acquiring and expanding our partnerships with those customers, including allocated overhead. We exclude stock-based compensation as it is a non-cash expense.  We believe that our contribution margin provides an important measure of the efficiency of our operations over time. We have included contribution margin because it is a key measure used by our management to evaluate our performance, and we believe that it also provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. Our calculation of contribution margin may differ from similarly titled measures, if any, reported by other companies. Contribution margin should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;).  For more information about contribution margin, including the limitations of this measure, and a reconciliation to loss from operations, see the section titled &#8220;Non-GAAP Reconciliations&#8221; below.  Non-GAAP Reconciliations  We use the non-GAAP measures contribution margin; gross profit and gross margin, excluding stock-based compensation; and adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We exclude stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, from these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. Additionally, we exclude employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation as it is difficult to predict and outside of our control.  Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain limitations, as they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Thus, our non-GAAP contribution margin; gross profit and gross margin, excluding stock-based compensation; and adjusted income from operations should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We compensate for these limitations by providing reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
