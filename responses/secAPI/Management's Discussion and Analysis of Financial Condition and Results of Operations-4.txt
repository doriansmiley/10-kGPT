Liquidity and Capital Resources  We generated positive cash flow from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. We had $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents available as of September 30, 2022. We believe that cash flows generated from operations, cash, cash equivalents, available funds, and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan (&#8220;DDTL&#8221;) facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. We have generated significant losses from our operations as reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and we expect cash flow from operations may fluctuate between positive and negative for the foreseeable future. Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of our equity securities, including proceeds from option exercises, and payments received from our customers.  As of September 30, 2022, our accumulated deficit balance was $5.9 billion, and our principal sources of liquidity were $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents.  As of September 30, 2022, we had no outstanding debt balances and additional available and undrawn revolving and DDTL commitments of $950.0 million under our credit agreement. During July 2022, we amended our credit agreement, which provided for, among other things, a new incremental DDTL facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $450.0 million, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the credit agreement. The DDTL facility is available to draw upon through July&#8239;1, 2023 and any drawn amounts will mature on March&#8239;31, 2027. The DDTL facility, together with our existing revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million, provides for total revolving and DDTL commitments of up to $950.0 million available to draw to fund working capital and general corporate expenditures. No amounts were drawn as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. For more information, see Note 6. Debt in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to the rate of our growth, our ability to attract and retain customers and their willingness and ability to pay for our products and services, and the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to market and develop our products. Further, we may enter into future arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services, strategic partnerships, and technologies. As such, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If additional funds are not available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.  Table of contents  The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 144,974 $ 240,424 Investing activities (118,508) (216,039) Financing activities 71,839 274,282  Effect of foreign exchange on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash  (12,470) (3,638)  Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash  $ 85,835 $ 295,029  Operating Activities  Net cash provided by operating activities was $145.0 million and $240.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by timing of the receipt of payments from our customers and timing of payments to vendors.  Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities was $118.5 million and $216.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of reducing our purchases of alternative investments and marketable securities, as well as selling or redeeming certain marketable securities.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities was $71.8 million and $274.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, each of which primarily consisted of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options offset by the principal payments on borrowings of $200.0 million made during the nine months ended September 30, 2021.  Contractual Obligations and Commitments  Our contractual obligations and commitments primarily consist of operating lease commitments for our facilities and non-cancelable purchase commitments related to third-party cloud hosting services.
