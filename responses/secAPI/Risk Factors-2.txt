Table of contents  timing of customer billing and payment varies from contract to contract. A delay in the timing of receipt of such collections, or a default on a large contract, may negatively impact our liquidity for the period and in the future. Because a substantial portion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short-term and require time to adjust, our results of operations and liquidity would suffer if revenue falls below our expectations in a particular period.  Other factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and financial position include, without limitation, those listed below:  &#8226; The success of our sales and marketing efforts, including the success of our pilot deployments;  &#8226; Our ability to increase our contribution margins;  &#8226; The timing of expenses and revenue recognition;  &#8226; The timing and amount of payments received from our customers;  &#8226; Termination of one or more large contracts by customers, including for convenience;  &#8226; The time and cost-intensive nature of our sales efforts and the length and variability of sales cycles;  &#8226; The amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business and operations;  &#8226; The timing and effectiveness of new sales and marketing initiatives;  &#8226; Changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;  &#8226; The timing and success of new products, features, and functionality introduced by us or our competitors;  &#8226; Interruptions or delays in our O&#38;M services;  &#8226; Cyberattacks and other actual or perceived data or security breaches or incidents;  &#8226; Our ability to hire and retain employees, in particular, those responsible for operations and maintenance of and the selling or marketing of our platforms, and develop and retain talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time and provide sales leadership in areas in which we are expanding our sales and marketing efforts;  &#8226; The amount and timing of our stock-based compensation expenses;  &#8226; Changes in the way we organize and compensate our sales teams;  &#8226; Changes in the way we operate and maintain our platforms;  &#8226; Unforeseen negative results in operations from our partnerships, including those accounted for under the equity method;  &#8226; Changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry;  &#8226; The cost of and potential outcomes of existing and future claims or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business;  &#8226; Changes in laws and regulations that impact our business, such as the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (&#8220;FASA&#8221;);  &#8226; Indemnification payments to our customers or other third parties;  &#8226; Ability to scale our business with increasing demands;  &#8226; The timing of expenses related to any future acquisitions; and  &#8226; General economic, regulatory, and market conditions, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and related economic sanctions and regional instability, and increasing inflation or interest rates.  In addition, many of our contracts contain termination for convenience provisions, and we may be obligated to repay prepaid amounts or otherwise not realize anticipated future revenue should we fail to provide future services as anticipated. These factors make it difficult for us to accurately predict financial metrics for any particular period.  The variability and unpredictability of our quarterly results of operations, cash flows, or other operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other key metrics for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the trading price of our Class A common stock could fall, and we could face costly lawsuits. We and certain of our officers and directors were recently sued in purported class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management&#8217;s attention  Table of contents  and resources. For more information, see Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Seasonality may cause fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position.  Historically, the first quarter of our year generally has relatively lower sales, and sales generally increase in each subsequent quarter with substantial increases during our third and fourth quarters ending September 30 and December 31, respectively. We believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors, including:  &#8226; The fiscal year end procurement cycle of our government customers, and in particular U.S. government customers which have a fiscal year end of September 30;  &#8226; The fiscal year budgeting process for our commercial customers, many of which have a fiscal year end of December 31;  &#8226; Seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in the United States, Europe, and certain other regions; and  &#8226; Timing of projects and our customers&#8217; evaluation of our work progress.  This seasonality has historically impacted and may in the future continue to impact the timing of collections and recognized revenue. Because a significant portion of our customer contracts are typically finalized near the end of the year, and we typically invoice customers shortly after entering into a contract, we may receive a portion of our customer payments near the end of the year and record such payment as an increase in contract liabilities, while the revenue from our customer contracts is generally recognized over the contract term. While we have historically billed and collected payments for multiple contract years from certain customers in advance, we have and may continue to shift to collecting payments on an annual or other basis.  While this has been the historical seasonal pattern of our quarterly sales, we believe that our customers&#8217; required timing for certain new government or commercial programs requiring new software may outweigh the nature or magnitude of seasonal factors that might have influenced our business to date. As a result, we may experience future growth from additional government or commercial mandates that do not follow the seasonal purchasing and evaluation decisions by our customers that we have historically observed.  For example, increased government spending on technology aimed at national defense, financial or policy regulation, cybersecurity, or healthcare mandates may drive customer demand at different times throughout our year, the timing of which we may not be able to anticipate and may cause fluctuations in our results of operations. The timing of our fiscal quarters and the U.S. federal government&#8217;s September 30 fiscal year end also may impact sales to governmental agencies in the third quarter of our year, offsetting, at least in part, the otherwise seasonal downturn we have historically observed in later summer months.  Our rapid growth in recent years may obscure the extent to which seasonality trends have affected our business and may continue to affect our business. We expect that seasonality will continue to materially impact our business in the future and may become more pronounced over time. The seasonality of our business may cause continued or increased fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows, which may prevent us from achieving our quarterly or annual forecasts or meeting or exceeding the expectations of research analysts or investors, which in turn may cause a decline in the trading price of our Class A common stock.  Our platforms are complex and may have a lengthy implementation process, and any failure of our platforms to satisfy our customers or perform as desired could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Our platforms and services are complex and are deployed in a wide variety of network environments. Implementing our platforms can be a complex and lengthy process since we often configure our existing platforms for a customer&#8217;s unique environment. Inability to meet the unique needs of our customers may result in customer dissatisfaction and/or damage to our reputation, which could materially harm our business. Further, the proper use of our platforms may require training of the customer and the initial or ongoing services of our technical personnel as well as O&#38;M services over the contract term. If training and/or ongoing services require more of our expenditures than we originally estimated, our margins will be lower than projected.  In addition, if our customers do not use our platforms correctly or as intended, inadequate performance or outcomes may result. It is possible that our platforms may also be intentionally misused or abused by customers or their employees or third parties who obtain access and use of our platforms. Similarly, our platforms sometimes are used by customers with smaller or less sophisticated IT departments, potentially resulting in sub-optimal performance at a level lower than anticipated by the customer. Because our customers rely on our platforms and services to address important business goals and challenges, the incorrect or improper use or configuration of our platforms and O&#38;M services, failure to properly train customers on how to efficiently and effectively use our platforms, or failure to properly provide implementation or analytical or maintenance services to our  Table of contents  customers may result in contract terminations or non-renewals, reduced customer payments, negative publicity, or legal claims against us. For example, as we continue to expand our customer base, any failure by us to properly provide these services may result in lost opportunities for follow-on expansion sales of our platforms and services.
