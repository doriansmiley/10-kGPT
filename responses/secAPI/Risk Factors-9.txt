operations could be negatively impacted.  In the future, we may not be able to secure the financing necessary to operate and grow our business as planned, or to make acquisitions.  In the future, we may seek to raise or borrow additional funds to expand our product or business development efforts, make acquisitions or otherwise fund or grow our business and operations. During April 2021, we fully repaid the outstanding term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million and mutually agreed with the lenders and other applicable parties under our revolving credit facility to amend our revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by $200.0 million, for total revolving commitments of $400.0 million. In March 2022, our revolving credit facility was further amended to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the revolving loan facility and increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by $100.0 million, and in July 2022, our revolving credit facility was further amended to, among other things, provide a new incremental DDTL facility in an aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the credit agreement, as amended, with new and existing lenders. The DDTL facility is available to draw upon through July&#8239;1, 2023 and any drawn amounts will mature on March&#8239;31, 2027. The existing revolving credit facility, as amended, matures in March 2027. The DDTL facility, together with our existing revolving credit facility, provides for total commitments of up to $950.0 million, all of which are undrawn as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any interest or facility payments are due and payable quarterly or more or less frequently in certain circumstances. Additional equity or debt financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.  Table of contents  Historically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances, proceeds from option exercises, and cash received from our customers. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months, we may require additional financing, and we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise equity financing to fund operations or on an opportunistic basis, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to, among other things:  &#8226; Develop new products, features, capabilities, and enhancements;  &#8226; Continue to expand our product development, sales, and marketing organizations;  &#8226; Recruit, hire, train, and retain employees;  &#8226; Respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements; or  &#8226; Pursue acquisition or other growth or investment opportunities.  Our inability to take any of these actions because adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.  Our debt agreements contain restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.  Our credit agreement and related documents, including our pledge and security agreements, contain, and instruments governing any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:  &#8226; Create liens on certain assets;  &#8226; Incur additional debt;  &#8226; Consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;  &#8226; Sell certain assets;  &#8226; Pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock;  &#8226; Place restrictions on certain activities of subsidiaries;  &#8226; Transact with our affiliates; and  &#8226; Use a portion of our cash resources.  Any of these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions and could otherwise restrict corporate activities. Any failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or instruments governing any future indebtedness of ours. Additionally, our credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. Upon a default, unless waived, the lenders under our credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments and cease making further loans, and, when amounts are outstanding, foreclose on our assets pledged to such lenders to secure our obligations under our credit agreement and force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, a default under our credit facility could trigger a cross default under agreements governing any future indebtedness. If we experience a default under our credit facility or instruments governing our future indebtedness, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely impacted.  In addition, a portion of our cash is pledged as cash collateral for letters of credit and bank guarantees which support certain of our real estate leases, customer contracts, and other guarantees and financing obligations. While these obligations remain outstanding and are cash collateralized, we do not have access to and cannot use the pledged cash for our operations or to repay our other indebtedness. As of September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions associated with our credit facility.  Variable rate indebtedness that we may incur under our credit facility will subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.  As of September 30, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under our credit facility. Any borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates, which exposes us to interest rate risk. Our loans under our credit facility would incur interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or a successor administrator of the SOFR (or the applicable benchmark replacement), plus 2.00% or a base rate plus 1.00%, subject to certain adjustments, and is payable quarterly or more or less frequently in certain circumstances.  Table of contents  We may acquire or invest in companies and technologies, which may divert our management&#8217;s attention, and result in additional dilution to our stockholders. We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions or investments. We are subject to risks associated with our investments, including a partial or complete loss of invested capital.  As part of our business strategy, we have engaged in strategic transactions and alternative investments in the past and expect to evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets in the future. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our products or our ability to provide services. An acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen risks, operating difficulties and expenditures, including the following:  &#8226; Any such transactions may negatively affect our financial results because it may require us to incur charges or assume substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose us to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims and disputes, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to such transactions;  &#8226; Costs and potential difficulties associated with the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business;  &#8226; We may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, infrastructure, products, personnel, or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us or if we are unable to retain key personnel, if their technology is not easily adapted to work with ours, or if we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership, management, or otherwise;  &#8226; We may not realize the expected benefits of the transaction;  &#8226; An acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses, result in unfavorable public perception, and distract our management;  &#8226; An acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of customer purchases for both us and the company acquired due to customer uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of service from either company;  &#8226; The potential impact on relationships with existing customers, vendors, and distributors as business partners as a result of acquiring another company or business that competes with or otherwise is incompatible with those existing relationships;  &#8226; The potential that our due diligence of the applicable company or business does not identify significant problems or liabilities, or that we underestimate the costs and effects of identified liabilities;  &#8226; Exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, the transaction, including but not limited to claims from former employees, customers, or other third parties, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our business faces;  &#8226; Potential goodwill impairment charges related to acquisitions;  &#8226; We may encounter difficulties in, or may be unable to, successfully sell any acquired products;
